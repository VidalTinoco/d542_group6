"I have a vue 3 application. I have a ref constant which is a list. When nothing changed to the ref for 3 seconds, I want to trigger a method. What do I need?","To achieve the behavior you described in your Vue 3 application, you can use a combination of the ref property, the watch function, and the setTimeout function. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement it:Import the necessary modules:
Make sure you have Vue 3 installed in your project. You can import the required modules like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Create a ref constant for your list:
Assuming you have a list that you want to monitor for changes:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Create a method to be triggered:
Define the method you want to trigger when the list remains unchanged for 3 seconds:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Set up a watch on the list:
Use the watch function to monitor changes to the list. If the list remains unchanged for 3 seconds, the triggerMethod will be called:[CODE_BLOCK_3]In this code, every time the myList ref changes, the watch function will clear the existing timeout and set a new one. If there are no changes to the list for 3 seconds, the triggerMethod will be executed.Remember to adjust the logic in the triggerMethod function according to your needs.Cleanup on component unmount:
To prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior, it's a good practice to clear the timeout when the component is unmounted:[CODE_BLOCK_4]With these steps, your Vue 3 application will monitor changes to the list and trigger the method after the list remains unchanged for 3 seconds.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': ""import { ref, watch } from 'vue';\n""}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': 'const myList = ref([]);\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_2]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': ""function triggerMethod() {\n  console.log('Method triggered after 3 seconds of inactivity.');\n  // Place your logic here\n}\n""}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_3]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': 'let timerId;\n\nwatch(myList, () => {\n  clearTimeout(timerId);\n  timerId = setTimeout(triggerMethod, 3000);\n});\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_4]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': ""import { ref, watch, onUnmounted } from 'vue';\n\nconst myList = ref([]);\nlet timerId;\n\nfunction triggerMethod() {\n  console.log('Method triggered after 3 seconds of inactivity.');\n  // Place your logic here\n}\n\nwatch(myList, () => {\n  clearTimeout(timerId);\n  timerId = setTimeout(triggerMethod, 3000);\n});\n\nonUnmounted(() => {\n  clearTimeout(timerId);\n});\n""}]",Vue 3 List Watch_https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse/discussions/3355,False,,2023-08-30T08:19:20Z,,,TypeScript,vueuse/vueuse,2023-08-30T15:17:58Z,1.0,Vue 3 List Watch,"Hi all,

 migrate back to git files tracked by GIT LFS,"Migrating back to regular Git files from Git Large File Storage (LFS) involves reversing the process of storing large files in LFS. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:1. Clone the LFS repository:
If you haven't already, clone the repository that contains the LFS-tracked files.[CODE_BLOCK_0]2. Install Git LFS:
If you don't have Git LFS installed, you need to install it. You can download it from the official Git LFS website: https://git-lfs.github.com/3. Fetch LFS objects:
Run the following commands to fetch all LFS objects that are not already present in your repository:[CODE_BLOCK_1]4. Checkout files:
Checkout the branch or commit that you want to work with. This will make sure the LFS files are accessible on your local machine.[CODE_BLOCK_2]5. Export LFS files:
You need to export the LFS files from your local repository. You can use the following command to find and export all LFS files:[CODE_BLOCK_3]This command will iterate through the LFS-tracked files, pulling them into your local repository.6. Convert LFS pointers to actual files:
Since you have fetched the LFS files into your repository, you can now replace the LFS pointers with the actual file contents. This can be done using the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Replace <pattern> with the file pattern you want to migrate. This command will replace the LFS pointers with the actual file contents in your Git history.7. Remove LFS attributes:
You need to remove the LFS attributes from the files in order to stop tracking them with LFS. Run the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_5]Again, replace <pattern> with the file pattern you want to apply this to.8. Commit changes:
After removing the LFS attributes, commit the changes to your repository:[CODE_BLOCK_6]9. Push changes:
Push the changes to the remote repository:[CODE_BLOCK_7]Replace <branch> with the name of the branch you're working on.Now your repository should no longer be using Git LFS for those specific files, and the actual file contents will be tracked in Git. Keep in mind that this process will modify your Git history, so make sure to communicate with your team if you're working in a collaborative environment.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git clone <repository_url>\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git lfs fetch --all\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_2]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git checkout <branch_or_commit>\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_3]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git lfs ls-files -n | while read -r filename; do git lfs pull -I ""$filename""; done\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_4]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git lfs migrate import --include=""<pattern>""\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_5]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git lfs migrate export --include=""<pattern>""\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_6]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git commit -m ""Migrate LFS files back to regular Git files""\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_7]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'git push origin <branch>\n'}]",Migrate Files from Git LFS_https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions/5457,False,,2023-08-09T09:56:54Z,,,Go,git-lfs/git-lfs,2023-08-09T10:00:47Z,1.0,Migrate Files from Git LFS,"hi,

Can I always use await import instead of plain import? Are there problems with it?,"The use of await import(...) and import ... in JavaScript serve different purposes and have different implications. Here are a few points to consider:Loading type: Regular import ... statements are static imports. They load modules at startup, before the module's code is evaluated. This means that all the dependencies are loaded upfront, which can increase the initial loading time if you have many dependencies or large ones.On the other hand, await import(...) is a dynamic import. It loads modules on demand, during the runtime of the module's code. This means you can conditionally load modules, or delay their loading until they're actually needed. This can decrease the initial loading time and memory consumption, at the expense of possibly introducing loading delays later on.Top-level await: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, await can only be used within an async function in JavaScript. This restriction has been relaxed in some environments, allowing top-level await, but it is not universally supported. So if you're working in an environment that doesn't support top-level await, you cannot use await import(...) outside of an async function. For maximum compatibility, you might need to use a static import instead.Error handling: If a static import fails to load a module (for example, if the module file is not found), the whole module fails to load, and any code that imports it will not run. In contrast, if a dynamic import fails, it returns a rejected Promise. This means that you can catch and handle the error using .catch() or a try/catch block. Depending on your needs, one or the other might be more suitable.Refactoring tools: Some code editors and refactoring tools have better support for static imports than dynamic imports. For example, they might be able to analyze static imports to determine which modules are no longer used, or to automatically update import paths when a module is moved.

    [Prerequisite Curriculum]
        Let's outline a prerequisite curriculum for the photoelectric effect. Remember, this curriculum will lead up to the photoelectric effect (0.1 to 0.9) but not include the topic itself (1.0):

        0.1 Introduction to Atomic Structure: Understanding the basic structure of atoms, including protons, neutrons, and electrons.

        0.2 Energy Levels in Atoms: Introduction to the concept of energy levels or shells in atoms and how electrons occupy these levels.

        0.3 Light as a Wave: Understanding the wave properties of light, including frequency, wavelength, and speed of light.

        0.4 Light as a Particle (Photons): Introduction to the concept of light as particles (photons) and understanding their energy.

        0.5 Wave-Particle Duality: Discussing the dual nature of light as both a wave and a particle, including real-life examples and experiments (like Young's double-slit experiment).

        0.6 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Brief overview of quantum mechanics, including concepts such as quantization of energy and the uncertainty principle.

        0.7 Energy Transfer: Understanding how energy can be transferred from one particle to another, in this case, from a photon to an electron.

        0.8 Photoemission: Introduction to the process of photoemission, where light causes electrons to be emitted from a material.

        0.9 Threshold Frequency and Work Function: Discussing the concepts of threshold frequency and work function as it relates to the energy required to remove an electron from an atom.

    [Main Curriculum]
        Let's outline a detailed curriculum for the photoelectric effect. We'll start from 1.1:

        1.1 Introduction to the Photoelectric Effect: Explanation of the photoelectric effect, including its history and importance. Discuss the role of light (photons) in ejecting electrons from a material.

        1.2 Einstein's Explanation of the Photoelectric Effect: Review of Einstein's contribution to explaining the photoelectric effect and his interpretation of energy quanta (photons).

        1.3 Concept of Work Function: Deep dive into the concept of work function, the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from a material, and how it varies for different materials.

        1.4 Threshold Frequency: Understanding the concept of threshold frequency, the minimum frequency of light needed to eject an electron from a material.

        1.5 Energy of Ejected Electrons (Kinetic Energy): Discuss how to calculate the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons using Einstein's photoelectric equation.

        1.6 Intensity vs. Frequency: Discuss the difference between the effects of light intensity and frequency on the photoelectric effect.

        1.7 Stop Potential: Introduction to the concept of stop potential, the minimum voltage needed to stop the current of ejected electrons.

        1.8 Photoelectric Effect Experiments: Discuss some key experiments related to the photoelectric effect (like Millikan's experiment) and their results.

        1.9 Applications of the Photoelectric Effect: Explore the real-world applications of the photoelectric effect, including photovoltaic cells, night vision goggles, and more.

        1.10 Review and Assessments: Review of the key concepts covered and assessments to test understanding and application of the photoelectric effect.

"Please assume the role of a Clojure code completion backend.

As such, your input is the contents of a Clojure file, along a request for a specific thing to be implemented, and your output is the content of that same file, after you have suggested code to insert.

The rules are:

* You must observe the existing namespace aliases, and use them when applicable.
* You must observe the existing functions, and use them when applicable (use their docstrings to determine their intent).
* You must not insert `require` forms: instead, you extend the existing `ns` form.
* You must return the code for the entire provided file: don't alter code that didn't need to be altered (but do include it), insert code as needed.
* Code you add must always be appended at the end of the Clojure file.

You only emit code for the resulting Clojure file. You never add any other observation in natural language.","Alright, I understand. Please provide me with the contents of a Clojure file and a request for a specific thing to be implemented.",[],Clojure Completion Backend._https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/discussions/3391,False,,2023-08-03T08:27:49Z,,,Emacs Lisp,clojure-emacs/cider,2023-08-03T20:03:45Z,3.0,Clojure Completion Backend.,"A clojure-specific ""gpt mode"" would seem nice / better than context-switching to chat.openai.com. For instance, one could send the buffer's `ns` form as part of the prompt, so that GPT produces a new one that is a merge of your stuff + suggested stuff.

(Otherwise, having to adapt top-level `(require '[,,,])` calls into the `ns` form is fairly cumbersome)

The response could be the whole new contents of your .clj file: existing + suggested contents. i.e. the buffer contents are replaced, you only hit save if you're happy.

Other bits of context that could be sent would be project.clj/deps.edn (so that it knows which libraries are preferred) or, who knows, maybe all your .clj files (with obvious IP concerns - I'd only do this if there was something like a .gpt-allow empty file at the project root)

Here's a POC session:

https://chat.openai.com/share/31edefae-845c-4ceb-abe9-64dcd95b473f

The way I thought of implementing this was at cider-nrepl level. Doing stuff with a Clojure backend seems better than a pure-elisp impl since:

* we can build ""context"" directly by inspecting files in PWD / the classpath
* we can build advanced HTTP requests (including sending/receiving files)
* overall greater ease/testability for intrincate features like dynamic prompt generation.

As mentioned, client-side, the impl could be as simple as replacing the whole buffer. But an agnostic backend can leave the choice open for more detailed clients.

"This is likely a very basic networking question.
I can set up an ALB on AWS set up such that requests to https://xx.xyz.com/ forward to LibreChat (also accessible via direct IP at http://xx.yy.zz.ww:3080). This works perfectly well.
However, what I want to do is forward requests from https://xx.xyz.com/chat-app to LibreChat. When I try to set this up, I get a blank web page, as it looks like the HTML cannot find the /assets directory. Is there something I need to change in the LibreChat configuration to enable this, or is this an ALB issue?","Based on the information provided, it seems you're trying to host the LibreChat application under a subdirectory (i.e., /chat-app). This can lead to challenges because many web applications, including chat platforms, are often designed to be hosted at the root of a domain (i.e., /).When you try to host them in a subdirectory, assets and endpoints might not load correctly since they may use absolute paths. For example, the application might be trying to load an asset from /assets/image.png when it's actually available at /chat-app/assets/image.png.To fix the issue, you can consider the following options:Modify the LibreChat Configuration (if available):Some applications provide configuration options to set the base URL or path. If LibreChat has such an option, set it to /chat-app. This will make the app aware of its new path, and it will adjust its internal URLs accordingly.Use URL Rewriting at the ALB:If the ALB offers URL rewriting capabilities (which might require additional AWS components like Lambda@Edge with CloudFront), you can rewrite incoming requests from /chat-app/* to / and similarly rewrite responses from / to /chat-app/.Reverse Proxy Configuration:Instead of modifying at the ALB level, you can introduce another layer like Nginx or Apache in between the ALB and LibreChat. This proxy can handle the URL rewriting and forwarding.Consider Using a Subdomain:Instead of using a subdirectory, it's often easier to use a subdomain like chat-app.xyz.com. Most applications handle being on a different subdomain much more gracefully than being in a subdirectory.Check for Browser Console Errors:Open your browser's developer tools and check the console for errors. You might find clues like missing assets or failed requests, which can give you a better understanding of what needs to be fixed.Check LibreChat Documentation or Community:It's a good idea to check the official documentation or community forums for LibreChat. Others may have encountered the same issue and could have solutions or workarounds.In conclusion, hosting web applications under a subdirectory often requires additional configuration and consideration. If possible, using a subdomain can simplify things significantly.

"You are an agent in a gridworld.
The environment is a gridworld with a 2D view from above. 
It contains a single agent and a number of objects.

The possible colors are:
red, green, blue, purple, yellow, grey

The possible objects are:
unseen, empty, wall, floor, door, key, ball, box, goal, lava, agent

The possible actions are:
left, right, forward, pickup, drop, toggle, done

        
The environment state is represented by a grid of size {2 * env.width}x{env.height}.
Eacg grid cell is described by a 2-character string, the first one for
the object and the second one for the color.
An empty grid cell is represented by the string ""  "".

# Map of object types to short string

""wall"": ""W"",
""floor"": ""F"",
""door"": ""D"",

The rules of the environment are:
1. You can pick up an object if you are standing on it.
2. You can drop an object if you are holding it.
3. You can toggle an object if it is in front of you.
4. You can move forward, turn left, or turn right.
5. You can only pick up an object if you are not holding anything.
6. When you drop an object, it will be placed on the grid cell you are standing on.
7. You cannot walk through walls. If you try, you will stay in the same place.
8. You cannot walk through locked doors. If you try, you will stay in the same place.

"Consider the following environment and mission: 

The environment state is:
WGWGWGWGWGWG
WG        WG
WG        WG
WGAR  AB  WG
WG  ^^    WG
WGWGWGWGWGWG

The mission is: 
put the red ball near the blue ball 

Describe how to decompose the mission into intermediate goal states using the functions defined above. ","Given the mission to ""put the red ball near the blue ball"", we can decompose this task into the following steps:Identify the positions of the objects of interest:
We need to locate the positions of the agent, the red ball and the blue ball in the grid. We use the get_position(grid: Grid, obj: str, col: str) function for this, passing in the object types and colors as parameters. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Plan a path to the red ball:
First, the agent needs to reach the red ball in order to pick it up. We will need a path-finding algorithm here that respects the constraints of the environment (like not walking through walls or over other objects). This step is more complex and may involve an algorithm like A* or Dijkstra's algorithm.Pick up the red ball:
Once the agent reaches the red ball, it picks up the red ball by using the 'pickup' action.Plan a path to the blue ball:
Once the agent has the red ball, it needs to navigate to the blue ball. This requires another application of the path-finding algorithm, from the agent's current position (with the red ball) to the position of the blue ball.Drop the red ball near the blue ball:

"You are an agent in a gridworld.
The environment is a gridworld with a 2D view from above. 
It contains a single agent and a number of objects.

The possible colors are:
red, green, blue, purple, yellow, grey

The possible objects are:
unseen, empty, wall, floor, door, key, ball, box, goal, lava, agent

The possible actions are:
left, right, forward, pickup, drop, toggle, done

        
The environment state is represented by a grid of size {2 * env.width}x{env.height}.
Eacg grid cell is described by a 2-character string, the first one for
the object and the second one for the color.
An empty grid cell is represented by the string ""  "".

# Map of object types to short string
OBJECT_TO_STR = {
""wall"": ""W"",
""floor"": ""F"",
""door"": ""D"",
""locked_door"": ""L"",
""key"": ""K"",
""ball"": ""A"",
""box"": ""B"",
""goal"": ""G"",
""lava"": ""V"",
}

# Map of colors to short string
COLOR_TO_STR = {
""red"": ""R"",
""green"": ""G"",
""blue"": ""B"",
""purple"": ""P"",
""yellow"": ""Y"",
""grey"": ""G"",
}

# Map agent's direction to short string
AGENT_DIR_TO_STR = {0: "">"", 1: ""V"", 2: ""<"", 3: ""^""}

An example environment state is:
WGWGWGWGWGWG
WGKB      WG
WG>>      WG
WG        WG
WG    AG  WG
WGWGWGWGWGWG

An example mission is: 
put the blue key near the grey ball        

        
The rules of the environment are:
1. You can pick up an object if you are standing on it.
2. You can drop an object if you are holding it.
3. You can toggle an object if it is in front of you.
4. You can move forward, turn left, or turn right.
5. You can only pick up an object if you are not holding anything.
6. When you drop an object, it will be placed on the grid cell you are standing on.
7. You cannot walk through walls. If you try, you will stay in the same place.
8. You cannot walk through locked doors. If you try, you will stay in the same place.
9. You can unlock a locked door with the correct key.
10. You cannot walk over objects. If you try, you will stay in the same place.

Describe how to decompose the mission into intermediate goal states using the functions defined above. ","Given the mission to ""put the red ball near the blue ball"", we can decompose this task into the following steps:Identify the positions of the objects of interest:
We need to locate the positions of the agent, the red ball and the blue ball in the grid. We use the get_position(grid: Grid, obj: str, col: str) function for this, passing in the object types and colors as parameters. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Plan a path to the red ball:
First, the agent needs to reach the red ball in order to pick it up. We will need a path-finding algorithm here that respects the constraints of the environment (like not walking through walls or over other objects). This step is more complex and may involve an algorithm like A* or Dijkstra's algorithm.Pick up the red ball:
Once the agent reaches the red ball, it picks up the red ball by using the 'pickup' action.Plan a path to the blue ball:
Once the agent has the red ball, it needs to navigate to the blue ball. This requires another application of the path-finding algorithm, from the agent's current position (with the red ball) to the position of the blue ball.Drop the red ball near the blue ball:
Finally, when the agent reaches a cell adjacent to the blue ball, it drops the red ball by using the 'drop' action.Remember, each of these steps can be thought of as an intermediate goal state on the way to accomplishing the overall mission. Also, this approach does not consider whether there's a path available to move near the blue ball after picking up the red one, or if the blue ball is surrounded by walls or other objects.

Are you familiar with the game flappy Bird?,"Yes, I'm familiar with Flappy Bird. It's a popular mobile game developed by Vietnamese game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen, under his game development company dotGears.The game was released in May 2013 and features a bird, which the player controls by tapping the screen. The aim is to navigate the bird through a series of green pipes that appear in its path, without colliding into them. The bird automatically descends and only ascends when the screen is tapped. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes scores one point, and the goal is to achieve the highest score possible.Flappy Bird is known for its simple yet challenging gameplay, which contributed to its viral popularity. However, in February 2014, Nguyen removed the game from both the App Store and Google Play, stating that it had become too addictive, which led to an outcry among its fans. Since then, many similar games (often described as ""clones"") have been created by other developers.",[],Flappy Bird Familiarity_https://github.com/amichai-bd/fpga_mafia/discussions/323,False,,2023-06-23T15:51:59Z,,,SystemVerilog,amichai-bd/fpga_mafia,2023-06-23T15:52:00Z,1.0,Flappy Bird Familiarity,"https://chat.openai.com/share/a2f661b8-6ab3-44a4-9efa-4fdcce950778

"I want to create a program that is training in neural network to play the game flappy Bird by having an starting point of weights and biases then adding some randomization to The offspring of this initial waiting boxes see how they all perform choose the best performing offspring and then starting the new generation of randomized offspring from the previous best performer.

I'm sure there's a technical term for this type of AI learning evolution thing can you please describe it in the correct technical way?","What you're describing is known as neuroevolution, a form of machine learning that uses evolutionary algorithms to train artificial neural networks. More specifically, it seems like you're interested in a particular type of neuroevolution called Genetic Algorithms.Here's a more technical description of your proposed approach:You aim to develop a neuroevolutionary approach to training a neural network to play Flappy Bird. This would begin with an initial population of neural networks, each with randomly initialized weights and biases.During each generation, these neural networks would play the game, and their performance would be evaluated, typically based on their score or longevity in the game.Next, a selection process would be conducted, which is inspired by natural selection. The best-performing neural networks—those with the highest fitness scores—are selected as parents for the next generation. This process is known as ""selection.""These selected networks would then be subject to genetic operations, such as crossover (also known as reproduction) and mutation. In the crossover stage, ""offspring"" neural networks are produced by combining the weights and biases of the parent networks. During mutation, some of these weights and biases are randomly altered to introduce variability and prevent premature convergence on suboptimal solutions.This new generation of networks, which comprises both the offspring and mutated versions of the highest-performing networks from the previous generation, would then be used in the next iteration of the process.The process repeats over many generations, progressively evolving the population toward better and better solutions, until a satisfactory solution (in this case, a neural network that can play Flappy Bird effectively) is found or a set number of generations is reached.The goal of this process is to leverage the power of natural evolution, effectively conducting a search through the space of possible solutions (i.e., the set of possible weights and biases for the network) to find a solution that maximizes the performance of the neural network on the task at hand.",[],Flappy Bird Familiarity_https://github.com/amichai-bd/fpga_mafia/discussions/323,False,,2023-06-23T15:51:59Z,,,SystemVerilog,amichai-bd/fpga_mafia,2023-06-23T15:52:00Z,1.0,Flappy Bird Familiarity,"https://chat.openai.com/share/a2f661b8-6ab3-44a4-9efa-4fdcce950778

"That looks good thanks.

I have another question regarding the technical way of creating this neural network.

I understand that the weights give each neuron value and importance value. So that weight can highlight the important data within the network. And from what I know the bias is used to offset in some way the final trigger of the neuron.

I guess the weights are definitely necessary. What about the biases? Is it common to create the neural network without biases?","Yes, you are correct that weights in a neural network are used to give each input feature a certain importance and that biases are used to offset the final activation value of the neuron.In a neural network, the bias is essentially a constant that is added to the product of the inputs and their corresponding weights before the activation function is applied. It allows for a shift in the activation function, enabling the neuron to fit the data better.In terms of necessity, while it is theoretically possible to train a neural network without biases, it's not commonly done because biases provide flexibility and help the network fit the data more accurately.Without the bias, each neuron's output would be a function strictly of the inputs. This means the decision boundary would always go through the origin (in a binary classification case, for example), which can severely limit the ability of the network to learn complex patterns.With a bias term, the network can adjust the outputs independently of the inputs, providing a much richer and more flexible function approximation capability. It effectively allows the activation function to be shifted left or right, which can be critical for successful learning. Thus, it is generally beneficial to include biases in your neural network models.",[],Flappy Bird Familiarity_https://github.com/amichai-bd/fpga_mafia/discussions/323,False,,2023-06-23T15:51:59Z,,,SystemVerilog,amichai-bd/fpga_mafia,2023-06-23T15:52:00Z,1.0,Flappy Bird Familiarity,"https://chat.openai.com/share/a2f661b8-6ab3-44a4-9efa-4fdcce950778

Many times when reading and hearing about these neural networks I keep hearing the term way and sometimes the bias isn't mentioned. Is that because in some cases they don't have biases or just because they simplify explanations by not mentioning the biases?,"In many general explanations or introductory resources, the bias term may not be mentioned because it simplifies the understanding of the basic concepts of a neural network. It's often easier to understand the fundamental mechanism of a neural network — input features being multiplied by weights and passed through an activation function — without also introducing the concept of a bias.However, in practice, most neural networks do use biases. The bias is an important component of the neural network that helps to increase the flexibility of the model to fit the data. Without the bias term, the neuron is restricted in its ability to represent and solve problems.To be specific, even though weights handle the influence of input data, biases allow you to shift the activation function to the left or right, which can be critical because it helps the network represent patterns that are not centered around zero.It's worth noting that in the field of machine learning, you'll often see a trend of starting with simpler models or explanations, and then progressively adding complexity as understanding improves. So, it's not uncommon to initially discuss neural networks in terms of weights alone, and then later introduce the concept of biases.",[],Flappy Bird Familiarity_https://github.com/amichai-bd/fpga_mafia/discussions/323,False,,2023-06-23T15:51:59Z,,,SystemVerilog,amichai-bd/fpga_mafia,2023-06-23T15:52:00Z,1.0,Flappy Bird Familiarity,"https://chat.openai.com/share/a2f661b8-6ab3-44a4-9efa-4fdcce950778

"Thanks.
Back to the mechanism that I'm trying to create to fine tune the neural network for the flappy Bird game.

If I'm trying to make something very minimal. So I'm going to have two inputs the x distance from the obstacle and the wide distance from the obstacle window. And there's going to be a single output which is to flop the wings AKA jump.

How many hidden layers should I have if I'm trying to make it as simple as possible and how many neurons should I have in each layer?","Designing the architecture of a neural network is often more of an art than a science, and it depends heavily on the specific problem at hand. However, for a simple problem like the one you've described, you could start with a small and simple network and then iteratively refine it based on its performance.Given that you have two inputs (X and Y distance from the obstacle) and one binary output (flap or not), you could start with a single hidden layer. This is often a good starting point for simple problems, and it can be surprising how powerful even a single layer can be.As for the number of neurons in the hidden layer, a common heuristic is to choose a number between the size of the input layer (2 in your case) and the size of the output layer (1 in your case). So, you might start with a hidden layer of size 2 (the same size as the input layer).Therefore, a minimal starting point for your network could look like this:Input layer: 2 neurons (corresponding to the X and Y distances)Hidden layer: 2 neuronsOutput layer: 1 neuron (representing the decision to flap or not)After implementing this basic version, you can start to experiment. You might try adding more neurons to the hidden layer, adding additional hidden layers, or tweaking other hyperparameters of the model. Remember, each problem is unique, and the optimal network architecture will depend on the specifics of the problem. In this case, you'd be looking for an architecture that can learn to effectively play Flappy Bird.Finally, remember to carefully monitor the performance of your model both during and after training to avoid overfitting. This is when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. In the context of a game, overfitting could mean the model plays one level extremely well but fails on others because it has essentially memorized the first level rather than learning the general mechanics of the game.",[],Flappy Bird Familiarity_https://github.com/amichai-bd/fpga_mafia/discussions/323,False,,2023-06-23T15:51:59Z,,,SystemVerilog,amichai-bd/fpga_mafia,2023-06-23T15:52:00Z,1.0,Flappy Bird Familiarity,"https://chat.openai.com/share/a2f661b8-6ab3-44a4-9efa-4fdcce950778

"Let's try and determine the values of the weights and boxes of the hidden layer that has one there and two neurons.

So what I think is that what the birds are trying to do is on the y-axis B underneath a barrier and when the x-axis is close enough jump.

What I'm describing is trying to get the bird to this specific location and once the x and the y are in the correct distance the bird should flop.

So if the why is very negative it means we're too far from this sweet spot so we should jump if the y is too high meaning positive we should not jump and then we should keep the bird in that steady position until the x is small enough and then we do the final jump to go through the obstacles window.

Can you please write down the weights and boxes that can create this behavior?","The specific weights and biases that would create this behavior can be difficult to specify exactly without actually running a training process, as the optimal weights and biases will depend on many factors, including the specifics of how the input data is normalized, the precise behavior of the game, and so on.However, I can try to give a simplified example that might give you some intuition. For simplicity, let's assume that both inputs (the X and Y distances) are normalized to be between -1 and 1.Let's say we have two neurons in the hidden layer. The first neuron could be responsible for detecting whether the bird is below the desired height. If Y is negative (meaning the bird is below the sweet spot), this neuron would fire, suggesting that the bird should flap. The second neuron could be responsible for detecting whether the bird is close enough to the obstacle (X is small).So the weights and biases for the hidden layer might look something like this:Neuron 1: weight for Y = -1 (negative because we want the neuron to fire when Y is negative), weight for X = 0 (we don't care about X for this neuron), bias = 0.5 (to adjust the firing threshold)Neuron 2: weight for Y = 0 (we don't care about Y for this neuron), weight for X = -1 (we want the neuron to fire when X is small, which means close to -1 in our normalized scale), bias = 0.5 (to adjust the firing threshold)Then, in the output layer, we could simply add up the outputs of these two neurons. If either of them fires, the bird should flap. This could be achieved with weights of 1 and a bias of -0.5 in the output layer (so the output is positive if either neuron fires).This is a very simplified example, and the actual weights and biases that would work best in practice would probably be different and would ideally be learned through the training process. Additionally, it's worth noting that in practice, you would typically use some kind of non-linear activation function in your neurons, which I haven't included in this simplified example.",[],Flappy Bird Familiarity_https://github.com/amichai-bd/fpga_mafia/discussions/323,False,,2023-06-23T15:51:59Z,,,SystemVerilog,amichai-bd/fpga_mafia,2023-06-23T15:52:00Z,1.0,Flappy Bird Familiarity,"https://chat.openai.com/share/a2f661b8-6ab3-44a4-9efa-4fdcce950778

So, the starting point here is, suppose you've typed some prefix like ""git d"" and now you want to search history for previous commands you've run that start with that prefix.

I haven't had to think about it since I set it up which is definitely what one wants! But also I have confidence that it's going to allow me to do whatever I want in the future.

I wanted to share this zsh widget in case its useful to others. So, the starting point here is, suppose you've typed some prefix like ""git d"" and now you want to search history for previous commands you've run that start with that prefix. Zsh provides this natively as widgets named `history-beginning-search-backward` and `history-beginning-search-forward` ([docs](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#History-Control)), which I bind to up and down arrow.

"""Pull request creation failed. Validation failed: must be a collaborator""","The error message ""Pull request creation failed. Validation failed: must be a collaborator"" typically occurs in version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This error is related to the permissions and access controls for creating pull requests in a specific repository. Let's break down what it means and how to resolve it:Collaborator Status: In most version control platforms, repositories have a list of collaborators or contributors who have permission to make changes to the codebase and create pull requests. Only those who have been added as collaborators to the repository can create pull requests by default.User Access: If you encounter this error message, it means the user attempting to create the pull request is not listed as a collaborator for the repository. As a result, the system rejects the pull request creation request due to insufficient permissions.To resolve this issue, there are a few steps to take:Confirm Collaborator Status: Ensure that the user attempting to create the pull request is indeed listed as a collaborator for the repository. They should be explicitly added as a collaborator or part of a group/team that has access to the repository.Check Repository Permissions: If you're an administrator or owner of the repository, double-check the repository's settings to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to create pull requests. If they are not a collaborator, add them to the list of collaborators.Fork and Create Pull Request: If the user does not have direct collaborator access to the repository, they can still contribute by forking the repository into their account. After making the changes in their forked repository, they can then submit a pull request from their fork to the original repository. The repository owner or a collaborator with sufficient permissions can then review and merge the changes.Organization Membership: If you're working in an organization account, ensure that the user is a member of the organization with the appropriate access rights. Organization-level permissions might override repository-level permissions.Personal Access Token: If the user is using a personal access token to authenticate, verify that the token has the necessary permissions to create pull requests.If you're encountering this issue while using a specific platform like GitHub or GitLab, it's also a good idea to consult their documentation or support resources for platform-specific troubleshooting.Remember that the exact steps to resolve this issue might vary based on the version control system or hosting platform you are using.",[],Pull Request Validation Failed._https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/discussions/1018#discussioncomment-6516641,False,,2023-07-22T05:10:17Z,False,1.0,C++,martinrotter/rssguard,2023-07-22T19:02:27Z,1.0,Pull Request Validation Failed.,"I tried to contribute to RSS Guard by adding 2 features, that I already contributed to [QuiteRSS](https://github.com/QuiteRSS/quiterss/pull/1115) years ago.

So, this is the description of my contribution :


I added 2 features:
    - RTL layout direction to feeds
    - A calendar to avoid old articles

**RTL**
This feature lets change the feed's articles from right to left for languages such as Arabic, Urdu, Hebrew, Farsi...
To enable it :  The desired feed -> Edit selected item -> Articles -> Right-to-left layout.

---
**Calendar**
This feature lets avoid downloading old articles to preserve a small database. So, if we cleanup the database, we can ensure that the articles with a date old than the chosen date (as above) will not be added to the database.
This works also with a new empty database.

To enable it :
  - Set a general date for all feeds (in Tools -> Settings -> Feeds & articles).
  - Set a date for a desired single feed (in The desired feed -> Edit selected item -> Articles).

"I'm building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user's email. I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.

I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.

I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.

I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.

Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.","Creating secure authentication workflows can be a tricky business, but it's great that you're giving this a lot of thought. Here are some options you might consider:Use a dynamic, non-secret value as a salt: Instead of hard-coding the salt or including it in the link, you could derive it from some other value that you're already sending. For example, you could use a hashed version of the user's email as the salt. This would provide unique salts for each user without you having to store them anywhere. However, since the email address itself isn't secret, this wouldn't necessarily add a lot of security - it would primarily serve to thwart precomputed dictionary attacks (""rainbow tables"").Include the salt in the link: While you're right that this reduces security somewhat, it might be a reasonable compromise given your requirements. A potential attacker would still need to break your encryption in order to use the link, and if your encryption is strong, this should be difficult. To make the links safer, consider using a secure random generator to produce the salt.Store the salt in a user session: This could work, but user sessions typically live on the server, so this would contradict your requirement of not touching the database (unless you're using a stateless JWT-style session, in which case you're back to sending the salt to the client).JWT tokens: You could use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to create the magic links. JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. You can include the user's email and an expiration time in the token, then sign it using a secret key. When the user clicks the link, you validate the token and, if it's valid and not expired, the email is verified. You don't need to store anything in the database, and there's no need for a salt because you're not hashing anything. The downside is that if an attacker gets your secret key, they can create valid tokens.TOTP for random numbers: If you're asking users to enter random numbers, consider using Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm. It generates a one-time password based on the current time and a secret key. The server knows the secret key and can generate its own OTPs to compare with what the user entered. The nice thing about TOTP is that it automatically includes expiration (because the OTP changes over time), and if you only accept each OTP once, it can't be reused even if it's intercepted.In general, make sure to use secure, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries. Older algorithms and libraries may have known vulnerabilities that make your system easier to attack. Consider also rate limiting attempts to use the magic link to mitigate brute force attacks.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"Thanks. A few follow-ups:

- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?
- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?
- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?
- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?
- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.","Option 1: This is a simple and effective approach for thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks, but keep in mind it is only as secure as the hash function you use. Since the salt isn't secret, a potential attacker could still make an offline attack if they get hold of your hashed data and know your algorithm. However, if you're using a strong encryption algorithm and a sufficiently complex key, this should be difficult.Option 2: There's not much difference in terms of security between options 1 and 2, but option 2 may be a bit simpler to implement. The main consideration here is that the salt should be randomly generated and sufficiently long to make guessing it impractical. Also, you should make sure that the generated links are only valid for a limited period of time to prevent their reuse if they are intercepted or leaked.Option 3: Putting the salt in a cookie would mean that it is tied to a specific browser, which could be inconvenient for users as you've noted. The risk of someone hacking into people's emails varies depending on the sensitivity of the data your app is handling. For most consumer applications, it's probably not a high risk, but it's not nonexistent either. If you're dealing with highly sensitive data, you might want to consider a more secure approach.Option 4: JWT tokens are signed but not encrypted by default, meaning the payload data can be read by anyone who intercepts the token. If an attacker has the secret key, they can forge tokens, which would be a problem. The key here is to keep the secret key secure. As for rainbow table attacks, they're more applicable to hashed values (like password hashes), not signed tokens like JWT. As long as you use a strong, secure secret key, rainbow attacks aren't really a concern for JWTs.Option 5: TOTP is a good solution, especially because it naturally prevents reuse of the code. However, typical TOTP codes are 6 digits long, which might be a bit long for users to type without errors. It could work in the query param for a magic link, but again, you would need to ensure that the magic link is used within a limited time frame. In practice, many services send TOTP codes via SMS or through an authenticator app. Remember, TOTP requires a shared secret between the server and the client. This secret must be securely stored and kept confidential, which might present its own challenges.Remember, security is all about trade-offs. Consider the sensitivity of the data you're protecting and the risks associated with different methods, and choose the method that provides an appropriate level of security for your specific situation.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.,"Sure! There are a number of good libraries for implementing TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) in Node.js. The most commonly used one is probably speakeasy.Here's a simple example of how you might use it:First, install the library with npm:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, you can generate a secret for a user:[CODE_BLOCK_1]When it's time to authenticate the user, you can generate a token and check it against the user's input:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Remember that TOTP tokens are only valid for a short period of time (usually 30 seconds). So if the time on your server is significantly different from the time on your user's device, verification might fail. If you're running into problems, you might want to consider using a NTP (Network Time Protocol) library to synchronize your server's time.To use this in a real-world scenario, you would need to securely store each user's secret (ideally in a hashed form), generate a token when the user initiates an authentication request, and verify the token when the user submits it.For added security, you might want to consider using a library like authenticator to generate QR codes that users can scan with an app like Google Authenticator. This would save them having to manually type in their secret.As always, remember that security is a complex field and there are many factors to consider when implementing any form of authentication. It's a good idea to do a thorough review of your system, possibly with the help of a security expert, before deploying it.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'shell', 'Content': 'npm install speakeasy\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': ""var speakeasy = require('speakeasy');\n\nvar secret = speakeasy.generateSecret({length: 20});\nconsole.log(secret.base32); // Save this value to your user.\n""}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_2]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': ""var token = speakeasy.totp({\n  secret: secret.base32,\n  encoding: 'base32'\n});\n\n// Check a given token\nvar userToken = '123456'; // Get this from the user\nvar verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({ \n  secret: secret.base32,\n  encoding: 'base32',\n  token: userToken,\n});\nconsole.log(verified); // if it's true, the token is valid\n""}]",Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?,"Implementing TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) from scratch without using existing libraries is possible, but it's a non-trivial task. The TOTP algorithm is defined in RFC 6238, and involves a number of cryptographic operations, including HMAC-SHA1 hashing and Base32 encoding.Here's a rough outline of the steps you would need to follow:Generate a Secret Key: This will be a random binary string, typically 80 bits or longer. You could generate it using a cryptographically secure random number generator.Share the Secret Key: You need to securely share this secret key with the user. Often this is done by creating a QR code that the user can scan using an authenticator app.Generate the TOTP: This involves several steps:Calculate the number of time steps between an epoch (usually 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) and the current time. The time step is typically 30 seconds.Convert this time step value to a byte array.Calculate the HMAC-SHA1 hash of this byte array, using the secret key.Perform some operations on this hash to convert it into a 6-digit number.Validate the TOTP: When the user provides a TOTP, you need to repeat the generation process and see if you get the same result.There are a number of complexities here, including handling time synchronization issues, ensuring all your cryptographic operations are secure, and dealing with different encodings and data types. Implementing these yourself can be error-prone and is generally not recommended unless you have a very good reason for doing so.If you're concerned about dependencies, one option could be to use a smaller, more focused library that only handles the HMAC-SHA1 and Base32 encoding parts, and implement the TOTP-specific parts yourself. But in general, using a well-maintained and widely-used library like speakeasy is going to be both safer and easier.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.

Could you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?","Using the same secret key for all users could pose a security risk. Here's why:The secret key is essentially the seed for the one-time password generation. If you're using the same secret key for all users, then the OTP generated at any given time will be the same for all users. This means that if an attacker manages to intercept or otherwise acquire a valid OTP, they could potentially use it to impersonate any user.Additionally, if the shared secret key were to be compromised (e.g., if an attacker gained access to your environment variables), they would be able to generate valid OTPs for any user. In contrast, if each user has a unique secret key, an attacker who compromises one key would only be able to impersonate that one user.That said, there may be scenarios where a shared key might be acceptable, depending on the specifics of your application and threat model. For example, if you're generating OTPs that are only used once and then immediately expired, and you have other layers of security in place, it might be less of a risk.However, it's generally considered best practice to use unique keys for each user to minimize the potential impact of a key being compromised.If you're looking to avoid creating a database table, one possibility might be to derive a unique secret key for each user based on some other unique attribute of the user (like their user ID or email), combined with a master key stored as an environment variable. But this has its own potential issues (for instance, you would need to handle key derivation securely), and in general it's still advisable to store per-user secret keys in a secure manner, which typically means a dedicated database table.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

If they match, the verification is successful.If the user entered a code manually, compare the entered OTP with the OTP from the database. If they match, the verification is successful.After successful verification, you should delete the OTP entry from the email_verification table to avoid reusing it.On User Requesting a New OTP: When the user asks for a new OTP/magic link:Generate a new OTP as in step 2.Replace the old OTP and timestamp in the email_verification table with the new OTP and current timestamp.This way, you're not storing the OTP in a cookie or a URL, you're keeping the database as the single source of truth, and you're maintaining a secure, user-friendly authentication workflow.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of ""email"" we'd use more generic terms?","Making your database table more generic shouldn't be an issue and could allow for more flexibility in handling different kinds of verification scenarios. This approach will make your authentication system more extensible, so that it can cover different verification needs beyond just email verification.For instance, instead of having a field named ""email"", you could have a field named ""identifier"", which could store either an email address, a phone number, or some other unique identifier depending on the use case. You might have another field named ""type"" to indicate the type of verification being performed (e.g., 'email', 'phone', 'two-factor', etc.).Here's a rough example of how you could structure your table:id: A unique ID for each entryuser_id: The ID of the user this entry belongs toidentifier: The value to be verified (e.g., email, phone number)type: The type of verification (e.g., 'email', 'phone', 'two-factor')secret_key: The secret key used to generate the OTPotp: The generated OTPgeneration_time: The timestamp when the OTP was generatedWith this structure, you should be able to handle a variety of verification scenarios.

"Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?
I'm thinking instead of ""generation_time"" I'll use ""expirationTime"" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?

Could you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the model(s) necessary for this?","Yes, removing the type field is fine if you don't need to differentiate between different kinds of verifications, and it does simplify your table structure.Changing generation_time to expiration_time is also a good idea. With expiration_time, you have a straightforward way to determine when a OTP is no longer valid and when it's safe to delete an entry from the table.Now, using Prisma, here's how you might define your schema:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this schema, each Verification is linked to a User. The Verification model has all the necessary fields: identifier for the value being verified, secretKey for the secret key used to generate the OTP, otp for the OTP itself, and expirationTime for when the OTP should expire.Keep in mind that the User model should be adjusted according to your needs.

"Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier (which would be the email). Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?","Yes, it's reasonable to disassociate the Verification model from the User if you want to use it for situations like registration where you don't have a user yet. However, you may want to consider how you'll handle the situation where a user is created, but not yet verified. This is where having a relationship between User and Verification could be helpful.In your suggested scenario, you would generate an OTP and email it to the user during the registration process, then, when the user verifies their email, you would look up the Verification entry by the OTP, retrieve the identifier (email), and create a new user with that email.Here's how your models might look in Prisma with the relationship removed:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Please keep in mind, with this approach, there are a few potential issues you'll need to handle:If a user initiates the registration process multiple times with the same email before verifying, you'll need to handle the possibility of multiple Verification entries for the same email.You'll need to handle cleanup of Verification entries once they're no longer needed.If you later want to add a feature that requires knowing which User a Verification is associated with (such as two-factor authentication), you may need to re-introduce the relationship between the two models.So while it does give you the flexibility to handle registration in the manner you described, it might complicate some future developments and add a bit of overhead for handling the above cases.

Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?","@@unique in Prisma:The @@unique directive in Prisma does not directly interact with upsert. @@unique enforces that the combination of fields it's applied to must be unique in the database.When using upsert (update or insert), if a matching record already exists in the database (i.e., the same verificationTarget and type), Prisma will try to update that record. If no matching record exists, it will insert a new one.However, if a matching record exists but the update would violate the unique constraint (for example, if you're trying to change the verificationTarget or type to a combination that already exists for another record), you would get an error because the unique constraint is violated.

Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.,"That sounds reasonable. Using a string for the verification type keeps your schema simpler and will still meet your needs as long as you're careful to validate the values in your application code.Here is your final schema with the type field as a string:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Remember that you'll need to enforce in your application code that the type field can only take certain values (like 'EMAIL', 'USER_ID'), and handle cases where an attempt is made to insert a verification with a type or verificationTarget that already exists.This schema gives you flexibility to handle different types of verification, while keeping your data model straightforward and easy to understand. It strikes a good balance between complexity and flexibility.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'prisma', 'Content': 'model Verification {\n  id                  Int      @id @default(autoincrement())\n  verificationTarget  String\n  secretKey           String\n  otp                 String   @unique\n  expirationTime      DateTime\n  type                String\n\n  @@unique([verificationTarget, type])\n}\n'}]",Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?,"If you have more than one combination of verificationTarget and type, it means you have multiple verification records for the same target. This could cause several potential issues:Confusion for users: If a user receives multiple emails with different verification codes, they might not know which one to use. This could lead to a poor user experience.Potential for misuse: If there are multiple active verifications for the same target, a malicious actor could potentially exploit this to try and verify an email address or account that doesn't belong to them.Increased system complexity: Managing multiple verifications for the same target increases the complexity of your system. You would need to decide how to handle cases where multiple verifications exist: Should the old one be invalidated when a new one is created? Should all be valid until used or expired? These additional edge cases could make your code more complex and difficult to maintain.Performance impact: If you have a large number of redundant verification records, it could increase the size of your database and potentially impact performance. This would be more of a concern for very large systems, but it's still worth considering.For these reasons, it's usually a good idea to enforce uniqueness for the combination of verificationTarget and type. This ensures that for any given type of verification, a particular target can only have one active verification at a time.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.","Adding the verification model to your existing application database versus creating a new, separate database for it presents a trade-off between simplicity and isolation. Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks.Including in the existing application database:Benefits:Simplicity: Having your verification model in the same database as the rest of your application data can simplify your architecture. You won't need to maintain a separate connection to a different database for the sole purpose of managing verification records.Consistency: By keeping all data in one place, you can take advantage of database transactions to ensure data consistency. For example, if you need to create a user and a verification record at the same time, you can do it in a single transaction.Drawbacks:Coupling: Changes in your main database schema or settings could potentially impact your verification data. This is especially true if the database becomes large and complex, making schema changes more risky.Potential performance issues: If your main application database handles a high volume of transactions, the added load of managing verification records could contribute to performance issues.Creating a separate database for verification:Benefits:Isolation: By keeping verification data in a separate database, you can ensure that changes to your main application database don't affect your verification process. This can make it easier to manage and scale each part of your system independently.Performance: If your verification process generates a high volume of read and write operations, moving it to its own database could alleviate potential performance issues in your main database.Drawbacks:Complexity: Maintaining multiple databases increases the complexity of your architecture. You'll need to manage multiple connections, handle cross-database transactions if necessary, and ensure that each database is properly backed up and maintained.Cost: Depending on your hosting provider, maintaining an additional database may add to your costs.Recommendation:Given your use case and the simplicity of the verification model, I would lean towards including it in your main application database. This would keep your architecture simpler and still allow you to handle verifications effectively.However, if you find that verification operations are adding a significant load to your main database, or if you want to maintain a strict separation of concerns, then it would make sense to move verifications to a separate database.

"I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?

What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?","You're correct in assuming that an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability of a hardcoded salt, but it's important to understand how and why this could happen.A salt is a random value that is generated for each instance of encryption, and it's usually concatenated with the password (or any other data you're encrypting) before the encryption process. This is particularly effective in preventing pre-computed dictionary attacks, commonly known as rainbow table attacks.A rainbow table attack works by pre-computing the hashes of all possible plaintexts and then storing them. An attacker can then simply look up the hash to get the plaintext. These are effective against systems where the same hash function is used across all records.Salting defends against this because it adds a unique value to each record, which means that pre-computed hashes are no longer effective. In this case, the attacker would need a unique rainbow table for each salt, which is computationally expensive and thus impractical.If you hardcode a salt, then you effectively have a system where the same salt is used across all records. This means an attacker only needs to compute a rainbow table once, which drastically reduces the complexity of an attack.Now, considering your case, where you're not storing the encrypted values anywhere, an attacker would have to intercept your encrypted tokens during transmission. This could happen through various methods, such as packet sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or by gaining access to the email account where the tokens are sent.If the attacker has the encrypted token and the salt (which is hardcoded, and so could be found out by inspecting your system or through other means), then they could attempt a brute force attack to figure out the original payload, or use rainbow tables if the hashing function is known and the salt is the same across all tokens.The advantage of a time-limited token is that even if an attacker manages to intercept and decrypt a token, it will be useless after the expiration time, which adds an additional level of security. This reduces the time window in which an attacker can exploit a stolen token.As for an encryption method that uses a shared secret key and doesn't bother with a salt, you might want to look at symmetric encryption methods, such as AES. AES encryption is very strong and widely used. However, it still requires a key, which should be kept secure and definitely not hardcoded into your system.In summary, while it's true that your method is less susceptible to typical rainbow table attacks, it's still vulnerable to other forms of attacks, particularly if the attacker manages to gain access to your encryption key or your hardcoded salt. Adding unique, per-token salts and keeping your secret key secure will significantly improve the security of your system.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.

From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired (and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically). Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway (so we'll apply good security practices around database access already). Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?","Yes, your characterization is largely correct. A Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) system, like the one we've discussed, indeed adds a significant layer of security.To clarify, in a TOTP system, the one-time password is generated from a shared secret and the current timestamp. The server and the client both generate the TOTP independently and then the client sends its version to the server for verification. If the server's generated TOTP matches the client's TOTP, then the client is authenticated.A key aspect of this is that the shared secret must be securely stored and protected against unauthorized access. In our case, the shared secret is stored in the database and associated with a particular verification event. If an attacker were to gain access to the database and the shared secret, they could theoretically generate the TOTP if the TOTP hasn't expired yet. However, once the TOTP expires, it's of no use to an attacker.So, the primary vulnerability of the TOTP system is the secure storage of the shared secret and the secure communication of the TOTP to the client (e.g., via email or some other means). If the database were to be compromised and the shared secret was stolen, an attacker could potentially generate the TOTP, but again, this is only useful if they are able to do this before the TOTP expires.Overall, implementing a TOTP system, as we've discussed, will provide a robust level of security for your application, particularly if you ensure secure storage of shared secrets and implement a short expiration time for the TOTP. The lack of a salt in the TOTP system is not a significant issue, as each TOTP is unique to a particular timestamp and shared secret, essentially performing a similar function as a salt in password hashing.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"I want to clarify something around the idea of the ""shared secret"" and the ""server"" and ""client."" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the ""shared secret"" and who is the ""server"" and who is the ""client?""

From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the ""shared"" adjective here.

And the ""server"" and ""client"" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.","I apologize for the confusion. You're correct. In the context of your application, the terms ""shared secret"", ""client"", and ""server"" may not be applicable in the traditional sense.Here's a clarification:The ""shared secret"" is indeed the secretKey in the context of your application, which is stored in the database. The term ""shared"" generally refers to the fact that it is known by both the server and the client in a typical TOTP setup. However, in your specific case, the secretKey isn't really ""shared"" in the traditional sense, as it's not communicated to the end-user or their device. It remains securely on the server side.The ""server"" is your Node.js server. It generates the OTP and verifies it when the user submits it for validation.The ""client"" in a typical TOTP setup usually refers to an application or device that is able to generate an OTP based on the shared secret and the current time. However, in your case, the ""client"" is the user who receives the OTP via email and then submits it for validation.Your system is essentially a server-side version of TOTP, where the OTP generation and verification both happen on the server, and the OTP itself is communicated to the client via email, rather than being generated by a client-side application or device.

"Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible (unlikely, but still possible) that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.","Indeed, the issue you've brought up could potentially arise with the TOTP method, albeit it's extremely unlikely due to the nature of the algorithm used to generate the OTPs. That said, it's always good to consider all potential edge cases in security.As an alternative, you might consider a hybrid approach. For the link-based authentication, you could generate a unique, longer token that you include in the URL. This could be done using a cryptographic random function, ensuring that the chance of collision is essentially nil. This token could be used to look up the user and expiration time in your database (as with the TOTP method), but wouldn't be easily manually typed by the user due to its length.For the manual entry option, you could use the TOTP method to generate a shorter, more easily typed code. This code could be used in conjunction with the user's email (which you could ask the user to provide again when they type the code) to look up the user and expiration time in your database. This would mean that even if two users happened to have the same OTP (which is extremely unlikely), they would be differentiated by the associated email.Here's an example of how this could look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note: This solution requires updating the Verification model to include a linkToken field, and creating a unique constraint on linkToken.

I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.,"You are correct in your assessment, and I understand your concerns. You're facing a trade-off between security and simplicity. The choice really depends on your specific use case, threat model, and your tolerance for risk. Let me break down the arguments for each side:Sticking with the existing setup (shared secret in environment variable):Advantages:Simplicity: It's straightforward to implement and understand. There's no need to manage a separate table in your database.No additional dependencies: The logic required to encrypt/decrypt tokens can be written with built-in Node.js libraries.Drawbacks:Security: If an attacker gains access to your server environment, they could retrieve the encryption key. This could then be used to generate valid tokens, allowing them to impersonate any user.Brute-force attacks: Although it would take significant computational power, an attacker could attempt to brute force your encryption given enough time and resources.Switching to the new setup (using TOTP and storing tokens in the database):Advantages:Security: Each user has their own secret key, reducing the impact if one user's key is compromised. Furthermore, even if the verification table is breached, the attacker would only be able to impersonate users whose verification has not yet expired, which is typically a small window.Protection against brute-force attacks: TOTP is resistant to brute force attacks because each OTP is valid for only a short period of time.Drawbacks:Complexity: The setup is more complicated, requiring additional database tables and more sophisticated logic in your server code.Additional dependencies: You would likely rely on external libraries for generating and validating TOTPs, adding potential points of failure.In conclusion, if you are willing to accept the risk associated with a shared secret and you trust your server's security measures, keeping your current setup may make sense, especially if the simplicity and fewer dependencies are appealing to you. However, if you want to follow best security practices and minimize potential risks, implementing the TOTP approach would be a better choice.Remember, no security measure is perfect, and the best solution is often a balance between security, complexity, and usability.

"Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?

Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.","Sure, I can provide a little more insight into these topics.Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability
The use of a shared encryption key in your environment variable means that every single token is encrypted and decrypted with the same key. If an attacker manages to intercept one of these tokens (for instance, via email), they could potentially try to brute force the encryption by trying different encryption keys until they find the one that decrypts the token correctly. This is admittedly a huge undertaking, requiring significant computational resources and time.However, it is also theoretically possible. With enough computational power, an attacker could gradually guess at your secret key until they arrive at the correct one. Once they have that key, they could generate valid tokens at will, thereby impersonating any user.As computational power increases and becomes cheaper to access (think cloud computing and GPUs), the feasibility of such brute-force attacks increases. That said, the likelihood of such an attack happening depends on your specific threat model, including who might want to attack you and what resources they have at their disposal.Server Environment Access
You are correct in your assessment. If an attacker has access to your server environment, you have bigger problems than just token forgery. They could do a lot more damage, including directly accessing your database, manipulating your data, or even taking over your entire system.The point here is that relying solely on a single shared secret in an environment variable for security introduces a single point of failure. If that secret is compromised, the entire security of your user authentication process is compromised. By having individualized secret keys for each user stored in a database, you distribute the risk. If one key is compromised, it doesn't endanger the rest of your user base.However, as you rightly pointed out, if the attacker has gained access to your server, they could potentially access your database and retrieve all the secret keys anyway, rendering the distributed risk point moot.It's a complex situation with a lot of variables, and your ultimate decision will depend on your specific circumstances and your evaluation of the risks and benefits. The most important thing is that you're considering these questions carefully and taking steps to protect your system and your users to the best of your ability.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?

If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?","Key rotation is indeed a common practice in cryptography to mitigate the risk of key exposure. However, the effectiveness of key rotation in preventing brute-force attacks depends on a few factors:Rotation Frequency: The rotation frequency should be set according to the perceived risk and capability of the attacker. In theory, a higher rotation frequency can make brute-force attacks harder by reducing the time window an attacker has to crack the key. However, too frequent rotation may cause operational issues, and tokens generated with old keys will become invalid unless you maintain a grace period system.Grace Period: As you mentioned, maintaining a grace period during which tokens encrypted with old keys are still accepted can help with operational smoothness during key transitions. However, this also means that the effectiveness of key rotation in preventing brute-force attacks is somewhat reduced, as the time window for cracking the old key is extended.Key Strength: Key rotation can be less effective if the encryption keys are not strong enough to begin with. If your encryption key is weak or guessable, an attacker might be able to crack it before the next rotation.Rotating keys regularly can certainly increase the security of your system, but it's not a silver bullet. You still need to consider other potential vulnerabilities and security measures. For instance, key management and secure storage of keys become more critical in a system with frequent key rotation. If an attacker can access your new keys (e.g., by compromising the system where keys are generated or stored), key rotation won't help much.Another potential vulnerability could be if an attacker is able to intercept the communication between the server and the client (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack). This could reveal not just the encrypted tokens, but also other sensitive information. Therefore, it's important to secure the communication channels as well, e.g., using HTTPS for web traffic.Additionally, secure handling of email communication is critical since the OTP is sent via email. If an attacker can intercept or access the user's email, they can get the OTP. Therefore, secure email practices, such as using secure email servers and encouraging users to use strong email passwords and two-factor authentication, can also be helpful.Lastly, remember that no system is perfectly secure. The goal is to make attacking the system more costly (in terms of time, effort, and resources) than the potential gain from the attack. A layered approach to security, which combines several security measures, can help achieve this goal.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.

However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.","If you have security concerns with the libraries available and are comfortable with implementing the algorithm yourself, it's an option to do so. The algorithm used for TOTP is relatively straightforward and is well documented. The RFC 6238 document outlines how TOTP works and provides test values to verify your implementation.In terms of libraries, if notp and speakeasy are not to your liking, one option might be to use a more general purpose library that includes HMAC and SHA-256 or SHA-512, and implement the TOTP algorithm yourself.Node.js built-in crypto module provides HMAC and hash functions which can be used to implement TOTP:Use crypto.createHmac to create an HMAC object using SHA-256 or SHA-512 and your secret.Update the HMAC with the current time step (the difference between the current time and the Unix epoch, divided by the time step length).Use hmac.digest to generate the HMAC value.Select a 4-byte window from the HMAC value (the selection offset is the last nibble of the HMAC).Convert the 4-byte window to a number, and reduce it modulo 1,000,000 or 10^6 (for a 6-digit code).If you prefer to use a library for this, you might consider otplib. It's a more recently maintained library, which supports both HOTP and TOTP, and allows you to specify your own HMAC function, which means you can choose to use SHA-256 or SHA-512.However, if you choose to implement it yourself or use lower level libraries like crypto, do ensure to follow best practices for security, as improper implementation can lead to vulnerabilities.Please note, this information was current as of my training data up until September 2021.

"I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?","You're correct that it's technically possible for the OTPs to collide (i.e., two different keys generating the same OTP at the same time), but it's statistically very unlikely if the OTP is a sufficiently large random number (e.g., a 6-digit number has a million possible values).However, if you make the OTP a unique field in the database, then in the rare case that two OTPs do collide, you'll encounter a database error when you try to insert the second one. If you're generating a sufficiently large number of OTPs, this could become an issue.An alternative approach is to use a combination of the OTP and the verificationTarget (or the verificationTarget and type if type is not removed from the schema) as a unique constraint. This would allow the same OTP to be used for different targets, but not for the same target. This could be reasonable as it's unlikely that the same target will get the same OTP twice in a short period of time, but it would depend on the specifics of your application.In summary, you can remove the unique constraint on the OTP field if you're concerned about collisions, but consider whether you want to enforce uniqueness in some other way.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?,"In the context of OTPs, enforcing uniqueness is not typically necessary. OTPs are usually intended to be used once and then expire, and are generally associated with a particular user or session. In fact, because OTPs are typically generated randomly, it's actually expected that occasionally you might have two identical OTPs in use at the same time for two different users or sessions.The unique constraint on the OTP in the database schema would only be useful in the unlikely event that you want to ensure that no two users could ever have the same OTP at the same time. This is not usually necessary, and in fact could be problematic, as it would potentially prevent a new OTP from being generated if it happened to collide with an existing one.Unless you have a specific need to ensure that all OTPs are globally unique, you can remove the unique constraint from the OTP field in the database schema.",[],Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads_https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/discussions/148,False,,2023-06-07T23:24:42Z,,,TypeScript,epicweb-dev/epic-stack,2023-06-07T23:26:21Z,4.0,Debating TOTP vs encrypted payloads,"[![totp](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/assets/1500684/f8ace33c-3136-478c-8441-a53ac95101c4)](https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/improve-ux-and-security-with-time-based-one-time-passwords-totps)

"Can you give me a short and simple explanation for what it means for a JS bundler to externalize a module?

If the output format is ESM, can you give me an example output from a given input?","Sure! When a JS bundler externalizes a module, it means that instead of including the entire module's code in the final bundled output, the bundler treats the module as an external dependency. In other words, it tells the bundler not to include the module's code in the main bundle, but rather expects that the module will be available separately at runtime.This is often done to avoid duplicating code when multiple modules depend on the same external module. By externalizing the module, the bundler ensures that all the modules share the same instance of the external dependency, reducing the overall bundle size and optimizing loading times.For example, consider two JS modules: main.js and utility.js. If main.js imports utility.js and the bundler externalizes utility.js, the final bundled output for main.js will contain a reference to utility.js but not its actual code. The assumption is that utility.js will be available at runtime through other means, such as being loaded separately via a script tag or provided by the environment.Example output of main.js (assuming utility.js is externalized):[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the output, you'll see something like:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Notice that utility.js is imported as an external module, but its code is not included in the bundled output.

"I want to get a PNG image of some stat cards I've created in my Nova Vue tool and include them in a PDF report I automatically generate every night. In order for me to do this I'm looking at some kind of tool or API I can use - which would be compatible with my Laravel application that can automatically login, go to that tool's URL then take a screenshot of the specific section and return the image. I am investigating various alternatives and would like to discuss the best way to go about this and then create a proof of concept of this working.","This is a complex task, but it's certainly possible. To take a screenshot of a specific section of a web page and convert it to a PNG image, you might want to look into headless browsers and automation tools, such as Puppeteer, a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Google Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.However, since your application is built with Laravel, a PHP framework, it would be more suitable to use a PHP compatible solution. For this, a library called Browsershot could be a perfect fit. Browsershot is a PHP library that uses Puppeteer under the hood and provides a simple and easy-to-use API to capture screenshots of web pages.Here are some steps you might follow to create your proof of concept:Install Browsershot into your Laravel application using Composer. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, you would run:[CODE_BLOCK_0]After Browsershot is installed, you can use it to take a screenshot. You'll need to specify the URL of the page, select the specific element you want to capture, and define the output file (your PNG image).

This might happen if Puppeteer wasn't correctly installed when you added Browsershot, or if Node.js cannot find Puppeteer in its module lookup paths.Try the following steps to resolve the issue:Check Node.js and npm versions.
Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed and that they are up to date. You can check this by running the following commands:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Browsershot requires Node.js version 7.6.0 or higher. If you need to update Node.js or npm, follow the instructions on the official Node.js website.Install Puppeteer globally.
Browsershot uses Puppeteer under the hood. Sometimes, Puppeteer might not get installed correctly or might not be found by Node.js. Try installing Puppeteer globally using npm:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Update your NODE_PATH environment variable.
Node.js uses the NODE_PATH environment variable to find modules. If Puppeteer was installed in a non-standard location, you might need to add that location to your NODE_PATH. You can do this in your terminal or add it to your bash profile so it's automatically set every time you open a new terminal. The exact command will depend on where Puppeteer was installed, but it might look something like this:[CODE_BLOCK_2]You can find the installation path of Puppeteer by running the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_3]Check permissions.
If you're running the command in an environment with restricted permissions (like a shared hosting provider), you may not have the necessary permissions to install global npm packages or to run Puppeteer. In this case, you'll need to work with your hosting provider or system administrator to resolve the issue.Reinstall Browsershot.
If Puppeteer is correctly installed and can be found by Node.js, but you're still seeing the error, it's possible that Browsershot was not correctly installed. Try reinstalling it with Composer:[CODE_BLOCK_4]Remember, these are general suggestions. The exact solution may vary depending on your specific server environment and setup. Always be cautious when modifying system files or changing settings on a live server.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'node -v\nnpm -v\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'npm install -g puppeteer\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_2]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/usr/local/lib/node_modules\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_3]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'npm list -g puppeteer\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_4]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'composer remove spatie/browsershot\ncomposer require spatie/browsershot\n'}]",Generate Nova Vue Card PNG_https://github.com/spatie/browsershot/discussions/742,False,,2023-06-07T23:35:50Z,,,PHP,spatie/browsershot,2023-07-03T10:45:19Z,3.0,Generate Nova Vue Card PNG,"Getting the following error:

","Even after properly setting the PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH environment variable and updating the Browsershot configuration, if you're still encountering issues, it's possible that the issue lies with the Puppeteer version.The installed Puppeteer version (20.5.0 as per your previous message) might not be compatible with the Chromium version (113.0.5672.63 as per the error message) on your server. Puppeteer v20.5.0 was released around 2022, and it might not be compatible with a newer Chromium version.Here are the steps to resolve this issue:Upgrade Puppeteer: Try to upgrade Puppeteer to a newer version that's compatible with the installed Chromium. You can do this by running the command:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Re-check Puppeteer's Chromium version: After upgrading Puppeteer, check the Chromium version that comes bundled with it:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This command will output the path to the Chromium executable that Puppeteer will use by default.Update Browsershot configuration: Update the Browsershot configuration with the path to the Chromium executable bundled with the newly installed Puppeteer version:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Make sure to replace /path/to/new/puppeteer/chromium with the actual path you got from the previous command.By upgrading Puppeteer and using the Chromium version bundled with it, you should hopefully resolve the compatibility issues that are causing the current error. If this doesn't resolve the issue, it would be helpful to know more about your server environment (OS, Node.js version, other relevant software) to provide more specific advice.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'npm install -g puppeteer@latest\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'bash', 'Content': 'node -e ""console.log(require(\'puppeteer\').executablePath())""\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_2]', 'Type': 'php', 'Content': ""use Spatie\\Browsershot\\Browsershot;\n\nBrowsershot::url('https://www.google.com')\n    ->setOption('puppeteer.executablePath', '/path/to/new/puppeteer/chromium')\n    ->save('example.png');\n""}]",Generate Nova Vue Card PNG_https://github.com/spatie/browsershot/discussions/742,False,,2023-06-07T23:35:50Z,,,PHP,spatie/browsershot,2023-07-03T10:45:19Z,3.0,Generate Nova Vue Card PNG,"Getting the following error:

"You are an agent in a gridworld.
The environment is a gridworld with a 2D view from above. 
It contains a single agent and a number of objects.

The possible colors are:
red, green, blue, purple, yellow, grey

The possible objects are:
unseen, empty, wall, floor, door, key, ball, box, goal, lava, agent

The possible actions are:
left, right, forward, pickup, drop, toggle, done

        
The environment state is represented by a grid of size {2 * env.width}x{env.height}.
Eacg grid cell is described by a 2-character string, the first one for
the object and the second one for the color.
An empty grid cell is represented by the string ""  "".

# Map of object types to short string
OBJECT_TO_STR = {
""wall"": ""W"",
""floor"": ""F"",
""door"": ""D"",
""locked_door"": ""L"",
""key"": ""K"",
""ball"": ""A"",
""box"": ""B"",
""goal"": ""G"",
""lava"": ""V"",
}

# Map of colors to short string
COLOR_TO_STR = {
""red"": ""R"",
""green"": ""G"",
""blue"": ""B"",
""purple"": ""P"",
""yellow"": ""Y"",
""grey"": ""G"",
}

# Map agent's direction to short string
AGENT_DIR_TO_STR = {0: "">"", 1: ""V"", 2: ""<"", 3: ""^""}

The environment state is:
WGWGWGWGWGWG
WGKB      WG
WG>>      WG
WG        WG
WG    AG  WG
WGWGWGWGWGWG

The mission is: 
put the blue key near the grey ball        

        
The rules of the environment are:
1. You can pick up an object if you are standing on it.
2. You can drop an object if you are holding it.
3. You can toggle an object if it is in front of you.
4. You can move forward, turn left, or turn right.
5. You can only pick up an object if you are not holding anything.
6. When you drop an object, it will be placed on the grid cell you are standing on.
7. You cannot walk through walls. If you try, you will stay in the same place.
8. You cannot walk through locked doors. If you try, you will stay in the same place.
9. You can unlock a locked door with the correct key.
10. You cannot walk over objects. If you try, you will stay in the same place.

It has three attributes:rows: The number of rows in the grid.cols: The number of columns in the grid.cells: A 2D list containing the cell representations.The from_string static method creates a Grid object from a string representation of the grid. It splits the string into lines, calculates the number of rows and columns, and creates the cells 2D list by iterating over the lines and splitting each line into cells.The __str__ method is a special Python method that returns a string representation of the object. Here, it's implemented to return a string that represents the grid in the same format as the input string.The @dataclass decorator is a Python feature that automatically adds special methods to the class, including a convenient __init__ method that accepts arguments to set the initial values of the instance attributes.So, this class provides a convenient way to create a grid, convert a string to a grid, and convert a grid back to a string.",[],Gridworld Rules: Understanding Environment_https://github.com/dtch1997/gpt-text-gym/discussions/6,False,,2023-06-26T19:24:52Z,,,Python,dtch1997/gpt-text-gym,2023-06-29T18:32:46Z,1.0,Gridworld Rules: Understanding Environment,"Original chat link: https://chat.openai.com/share/259b2ba2-46e2-4d57-a509-ec07c2ce4e4a

```","Alright, let's implement these functions. We will need to iterate over the environment grid in each of them.

Provide feedback on the functions you have implemented. ,"The functions implemented are designed to interact with the Grid class and retrieve useful information about the state of the gridworld environment. Here's some feedback on each function:exists_obj(grid: Grid, obj: str, col: str) -> bool:
This function checks whether an object of a certain type and color exists in the grid. The function is correct and efficient, as it will stop checking as soon as it finds the first instance of the object.get_position(grid: Grid, obj: str, col: str) -> Tuple[int, int]:
This function gets the position of an object of a certain type and color in the grid. This function will return the position of the first instance it encounters if there are multiple instances of the same object and color. If the function needs to support multiple instances of the same object, it could be modified to return a list of positions rather than a single position.get_agent_position(grid: Grid) -> Tuple[int, int]:
This function returns the position of the agent in the grid. Since there should only be one agent, this function works well for its purpose.get_agent_direction(grid: Grid) -> str:
This function returns the direction the agent is facing. Like the agent position function, this function is correct under the assumption that there is only one agent.It's important to note that all these functions assume a well-formed grid and correct usage. They do not have checks to validate that the input grid is formed correctly, that the object and color strings are valid, or that the agent exists. Depending on the use case, it might be useful to add error checking and handling mechanisms to these functions to make them more robust.",[],Gridworld Rules: Understanding Environment_https://github.com/dtch1997/gpt-text-gym/discussions/6,False,,2023-06-26T19:24:52Z,,,Python,dtch1997/gpt-text-gym,2023-06-29T18:32:46Z,1.0,Gridworld Rules: Understanding Environment,"Original chat link: https://chat.openai.com/share/259b2ba2-46e2-4d57-a509-ec07c2ce4e4a

Are all your functions correct? ,"Yes, assuming the environment setup and the constraints as you mentioned, the functions should be correct. Here is a summary:exists_obj(grid: Grid, obj: str, col: str) -> bool: This function iterates over the grid until it finds a cell that contains the specified object with the specified color, at which point it returns True. If it iterates over the entire grid without finding such a cell, it returns False.get_position(grid: Grid, obj: str, col: str) -> Tuple[int, int]: This function works similarly to the exists_obj function, but instead of returning True when it finds the specified object with the specified color, it returns the position of that cell in the grid. If it does not find such a cell, it returns (-1, -1).get_agent_position(grid: Grid) -> Tuple[int, int]: This function iterates over the grid until it finds the agent, then returns the agent's position. If it does not find the agent, it returns (-1, -1).get_agent_direction(grid: Grid) -> str: This function iterates over the grid until it finds the agent, then returns the direction the agent is facing, based on the character representing the agent. If it does not find the agent, it returns None.In each case, the function does exactly what is specified by its docstring.However, these functions don't include error checking code, and they assume that the input they receive is well-formed. If used in a context where the input might not be well-formed (for example, if obj or col might not be keys in OBJECT_TO_STR or COLOR_TO_STR, respectively), they could throw exceptions. Additionally, the get_position function assumes that there is at most one instance of each object and color combination in the grid. If this is not the case, it will return the position of the first instance it finds, and other instances will be ignored. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to add additional error checking and handling code to these functions.",[],Gridworld Rules: Understanding Environment_https://github.com/dtch1997/gpt-text-gym/discussions/6,False,,2023-06-26T19:24:52Z,,,Python,dtch1997/gpt-text-gym,2023-06-29T18:32:46Z,1.0,Gridworld Rules: Understanding Environment,"Original chat link: https://chat.openai.com/share/259b2ba2-46e2-4d57-a509-ec07c2ce4e4a

The tabs shouldn't be identified only by URL as a session may have many tabs with same URL","If you want to keep track of all tabs, even across browser restarts, and you don't want to rely solely on URLs for identification, you can use a combination of techniques to achieve this:Persistent Storage: Utilize the chrome.storage API to store information about the tabs. This API allows you to store data that persists even after the browser is restarted. You can store tab-related information along with a unique identifier for each tab.Unique Tab Identifier: Generate a unique identifier for each tab in your extension. You can assign a unique ID to each tab when it is created or when your extension is first installed. You can use techniques like UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) or other algorithms to ensure uniqueness.Event Listeners: Use event listeners such as chrome.tabs.onCreated, chrome.tabs.onUpdated, and chrome.tabs.onRemoved to track tab creation, updates, and removal. When a tab is created, updated, or removed, you can store or update the relevant information in the persistent storage along with the unique tab identifier.By combining these techniques, you can maintain a persistent record of all tabs in your extension, even across browser restarts.

"When a browser is closed and reopen, what info of the tabs gets persisted for next restart?","When a browser is closed and reopened, the following information about the tabs typically gets persisted for the next restart:URL: The URLs of the tabs are typically restored. This allows the browser to reopen the same web pages that were open before the browser was closed.History and Back/Forward Navigation: The browsing history and the state of back/forward navigation are usually preserved. This means that when the browser is reopened, you can navigate back and forward through the pages you visited in the previous session.Pinned Tabs: If any tabs were pinned before closing the browser, they are usually restored as pinned tabs in the next session.Tab Order: The order of the tabs is generally preserved. If you had multiple tabs open in a specific order before closing the browser, they will usually be restored in the same order when the browser is reopened.Unsaved Form Data: In some cases, if you had entered data into form fields on a webpage but had not submitted the form before closing the browser, the unsaved form data may be restored when the browser is reopened.It's important to note that the specific behavior may vary depending on the browser and its settings.

"Ok, then a workaround would be to identify tabs by window, position and URL, whether it's pinned. In the case of a tab that changes URL on browser restart, previous URL would have to be looked at in its tab history, right?","Yes, identifying tabs based on window, position, URL, and pinned status can be a viable workaround when persistently tracking tabs across browser restarts. This combination of attributes can help differentiate tabs and provide a reasonable level of identification.If a tab changes its URL between browser restarts, and you want to access the previous URL, you can utilize the tab's history. The browser typically maintains a history of visited URLs for each tab, which includes the previous URLs visited within that tab's session.To access the tab's history and retrieve the previous URL, you can use the chrome.tabs.get method along with the tabId to get detailed information about the tab, including its history. Here's an example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the above code, tabId represents the unique identifier of the tab you want to retrieve information for. The chrome.tabs.get method retrieves the tab information, including the current URL (tab.url) and the tab's history (tab.history). You can access the previous URL from the tab.url property and explore the tab.history array to retrieve additional URLs from the tab's session history.By utilizing this approach, you can track tabs based on their window, position, URL, and pinned status, and retrieve the previous URL if a tab's URL has changed between browser restarts.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'javascript', 'Content': 'chrome.tabs.get(tabId, function(tab) {\n  var previousUrl = tab.url;\n  var historyUrls = tab.history;\n  // Process the previous URL and history as needed\n});\n'}]",Chrome Extension Tab IDs_https://github.com/gioxx/MarvellousSuspender/discussions/213#discussioncomment-6207346,False,,2023-06-18T02:59:49Z,False,0.0,JavaScript,gioxx/MarvellousSuspender,2023-06-18T04:04:45Z,0.0,Chrome Extension Tab IDs,"Greetings Community!

"Can I add custom properties to tab objects, such as an ID generated by my extension?
Will those persist?","No, you cannot directly add custom properties to the tab objects provided by the browser's extension APIs. The tab objects returned by the APIs are read-only, and any modifications you make to them will not persist or be saved by the browser.However, you can use other approaches to associate custom data or identifiers with tabs in your extension:Persistent Storage: You can use the chrome.storage API (Chrome) or the browser.storage API (Firefox) to store custom data related to tabs. This allows you to save and retrieve information associated with specific tab identifiers or other unique identifiers you generate within your extension. The stored data will persist even when the browser is restarted.External Data Structure: You can maintain an external data structure within your extension (e.g., an array or object) that maps custom identifiers to tab objects or other tab-related data. This allows you to associate custom properties or IDs with tabs and keep track of them within your extension. However, you would need to manage this data structure and ensure synchronization with the tab objects when relevant events occur (e.g., tab creation, removal, or updates).By using these techniques, you can effectively associate custom properties or IDs with tabs in your extension and persistently store the associated data even across browser restarts.",[],Free App Logging Alternatives_https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/discussions/334#discussioncomment-6018173,False,,2023-05-27T09:25:22Z,,,TypeScript,ubiquity/ubiquibot,2023-05-27T10:54:04Z,1.0,Free App Logging Alternatives,"https://t.me/UbiquityDAO/29891/30084

- `@inertiajs/core` version: 1.0.10

### Describe the problem:

Currently, Inertia does not provide a specific event hook for intercepting and canceling browser back and forward navigation. While the library allows capturing in-page navigation, handling navigation through the browser's back and forward buttons is not directly supported. This limitation poses challenges for scenarios such as warning users about unsaved changes, as well as other contexts where controlling or canceling back and forward navigation is necessary.

The expected behavior would be to have a way within Inertia to easily detect and optionally cancel back and forward navigation, possibly through specific events or hooks designed for this purpose.

### Steps to reproduce:

1. **Create a component with unsaved changes state**: Create a form with some input fields, and use a state to track whether there are unsaved changes.
2. **Modify without saving**: Modify the input without saving, thus setting the unsaved changes state to true.
3. **Attempt to navigate away**: Use the browser's back or forward buttons to attempt navigation away from the page.
4. **No handling for unsaved changes**: Observe that there is no built-in way within Inertia to intercept this navigation, warn the user, or cancel the navigation.

The absence of an event hook or mechanism within Inertia to handle browser back and forward navigation necessitates workarounds, such as using the `popstate` event, which may interfere with other client-side routing logic.

### My preferred implementation
```ts
export default function useUnsavedChanges(active: boolean): void {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleInertiaNavigation = (event: Event): void => {
      if (hasUnsavedChanges) {
        const confirmed = window.confirm('You have unsaved changes! Are you sure you want to leave?');

        if (!confirmed) {
          event.preventDefault();
        }
      }
    };

    return router.on('beforeNavigateHistory', handleInertiaNavigation);
  }, [hasUnsavedChanges]);
}

At least I'd like to be able to cancel the functions Inertia executes with this event to implement my own hack. Normally, the browser would dispatch an unload event when using normal navigation. So, I think it should be possible to replicate the same functionality.

まず、ACPI（Advanced Configuration and Power Interface）サポートが有効になっていることを確認してください。これは、あなたのマシンが電源ボタンの押下を認識できるようにする機能です。これを確認するためには、以下のコマンドを使います：

```
grep -i acpi /boot/config-$(uname -r)
```
出力が CONFIG_ACPI=y を含んでいれば、ACPIが有効になっていることが確認できます。

次に、/etc/acpi/events/ ディレクトリに新しい設定ファイルを作成します。例えば powerbtn という名前でファイルを作成します：

```
sudo nano /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn
```
このファイルに以下の内容を記述します：

```
event=button/power (PBTN|PWRF)
action=/sbin/shutdown -h now
```

これは、電源ボタン (PBTN または PWRF) が押されたときに /sbin/shutdown -h now コマンドを実行するという意味です。

最後に、ACPIデーモンをリスタートします：

```
sudo service acpid restart
```
これで、電源ボタンを押すとシステムがシャットダウンするはずです。

event=button/power (PBTN|PWRF)
action=/sbin/shutdown -h now
```

これは、電源ボタン (PBTN または PWRF) が押されたときに /sbin/shutdown -h now コマンドを実行するという意味です。

最後に、ACPIデーモンをリスタートします：

```
sudo service acpid restart
```
これで、電源ボタンを押すとシステムがシャットダウンするはずです。

それでも問題が解決しない場合は、具体的なエラーメッセージやシステムの詳細情報を教えていただければ、より具体的なアドバイスが可能です。

When history popstate is not called? So normal navigation is used. Is the before unload event than dispatched?,"Yes, when the user performs a normal navigation (e.g., by clicking on a link or entering a new URL), the beforeunload event is typically dispatched. This event allows you to show a confirmation dialog to the user before they navigate away from the current page. The purpose of this event is to give the user an opportunity to confirm their intent to leave the page, especially if they have unsaved changes.However, it's important to note that the beforeunload event and the popstate event serve slightly different purposes. The beforeunload event is mainly used to handle user-initiated navigation, while the popstate event is triggered when the user navigates using the browser's back or forward buttons, or when you programmatically change the history state using history.pushState() or history.replaceState().Keep in mind that browser behavior and event dispatch can vary, so it's always a good practice to thoroughly test your code across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.",[],EVM Slots ≠ EVM Words_https://github.com/sablier-labs/v2-core/discussions/552#discussioncomment-6264652,True,2023-06-25T09:46:47Z,2023-06-16T14:57:58Z,False,1.0,Solidity,sablier-labs/v2-core,2023-06-25T09:46:47Z,1.0,EVM Slots ≠ EVM Words,"As of now, only the structs that are known to later be initialized and kept in contract `storage` have the information about how much memory (slots-wise) they occupy.

The advantages of this approach are:
1. the increased code readability and

"In the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is the term ""slot"" equivalent to ""word"" when referring to storage slots? that is, can I refer to storage slots as ""EVM words""?","In the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the terms ""slot"" and ""word"" are not exactly the same, and they should not be used interchangeably.A ""slot"" refers to a unit of storage on the EVM. Each slot is 32 bytes (or 256 bits) in size. The EVM's storage is a key-value store where each key is a 256-bit number and each value is a 256-bit number, where the key can be thought of as the slot's index and the value is what is stored in that slot.On the other hand, a ""word"" in EVM terminology is also a 32-byte (256-bit) unit, but it is used in a different context. ""Words"" often refer to units of data used in memory or on the stack, as well as for the data passed to and returned by function calls. When EVM instructions operate on data, they do so on these ""words"".So, while both ""slots"" and ""words"" are 256-bit units, they are used in different contexts - ""slots"" for storage and ""words"" for data manipulation, memory, and function calls.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

startActivity를 이용해서 아래와 같은 투명 액티비티를 호출하는 경우, onPause 뿐만 아니라 onStop 까지 호출되고, 투명 액티비티만 보입니다.

```xml
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""

AndroidManifest에서 투명 액티비티의 theme을  `android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar""`로 설정하면
onPause까지만 호출되고, 투명 액티비티를 호출한 액티비티가 보입니다. 
이때, TransparentActivity가 AppCompatActivity를 상속하면 `java.lang.IllegalStateException: You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity.` 에러가 발생해서, `Activity`를 상속하도록 수정했습니다.

화면을 터치해도 투명 액티비티 아래에 있는 액티비티로 터치가 전달되지는 않았습니다.

![투명](https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/assets/48354989/5b954ecc-d28e-4590-8816-a03d217f27cc)


반면 `FragmentTransaction.add` 함수를 통해 A Fragment 위에 B Fragment를 호출할 경우, B Fragment의 투명성과 무관하게 A Fragment는 RESUMED 상태를 유지합니다.
또한 B Fragment에 touch Event를 처리할 view가 없다면, A Fragment로 touch Event가 전달됩니다.

Activity와 Fragment를 비교한 이유는 ChatGPT가  ""Android에서, View(투명한지와 무관)가 touch event를 처리(consume)하지 않으면 touch event는 그 아래에 있는 View로 전달된다.""고 알려줬는데, Activity에서도 동일한지 확인하고 싶었습니다.

Activity와 Fragment의 lifecylcle 처리 방식이 다르기 때문에, 투명한 View가 앞에 있을 때의 결과가 다르다는 것을 배웠습니다.

1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

반면 `FragmentTransaction.add` 함수를 통해 A Fragment 위에 B Fragment를 호출할 경우, B Fragment의 투명성과 무관하게 A Fragment는 RESUMED 상태를 유지합니다.
또한 B Fragment에 touch Event를 처리할 view가 없다면, A Fragment로 touch Event가 전달됩니다.

Activity와 Fragment를 비교한 이유는 ChatGPT가  ""Android에서, View(투명한지와 무관)가 touch event를 처리(consume)하지 않으면 touch event는 그 아래에 있는 View로 전달된다.""고 알려줬는데, Activity에서도 동일한지 확인하고 싶었습니다.

Activity와 Fragment의 lifecylcle 처리 방식이 다르기 때문에, 투명한 View가 앞에 있을 때의 결과가 다르다는 것을 배웠습니다.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

can you convert it to a kubernetes file?,"Sure! To convert the services defined in your docker-compose.yml file into a Kubernetes manifest, we'll create a Kubernetes Deployment for each service.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

AndroidManifest에서 투명 액티비티의 theme을  `android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar""`로 설정하면

반면 `FragmentTransaction.add` 함수를 통해 A Fragment 위에 B Fragment를 호출할 경우, B Fragment의 투명성과 무관하게 A Fragment는 RESUMED 상태를 유지합니다.
또한 B Fragment에 touch Event를 처리할 view가 없다면, A Fragment로 touch Event가 전달됩니다.

Activity와 Fragment를 비교한 이유는 ChatGPT가  ""Android에서, View(투명한지와 무관)가 touch event를 처리(consume)하지 않으면 touch event는 그 아래에 있는 View로 전달된다.""고 알려줬는데, Activity에서도 동일한지 확인하고 싶었습니다.

"I has a question about Fully transparent fragment.

And I call below code to add transaprent SettingFragment in front of other Fragment.

What I want to ask is why other Fragment's view is clicked even SettingFragment is called? ","If you're finding that touch events are still being registered by the Fragment beneath your transparent SettingFragment, it could be because you're not consuming the touch events in the SettingFragment itself.When you have a transparent view (or in this case, a transparent fragment), touch events will pass through to whatever is below it, unless you tell it to consume the touch events. In Android, this is typically done by returning true from an onTouchEvent() method to indicate that the event has been handled.However, in the case of a transparent Fragment, the better solution would be to create an invisible view that captures all touch events. You can do this by adding a full-sized, transparent View to your fragment layout:[CODE_BLOCK_0]And then in your fragment code, set an onTouchListener for this view to consume the touch events:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will create a view that doesn't actually do anything except consume touch events, effectively blocking the Fragment below from receiving them.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>\n<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""\n    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""\n    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""\n    android:layout_width=""match_parent""\n    android:layout_height=""match_parent""\n    android:background=""@android:color/transparent""\n    tools:context="".ui.game.SettingFragment"">\n\n    <View\n        android:id=""@+id/touchInterceptor""\n        android:layout_width=""0dp""\n        android:layout_height=""0dp""\n        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=""parent""\n        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=""parent""\n        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=""parent""\n        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=""parent"" />\n\n</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'kotlin', 'Content': 'val touchInterceptor = view.findViewById<View>(R.id.touchInterceptor)\ntouchInterceptor.setOnTouchListener { _, _ -> true }\n'}]",Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

AndroidManifest에서 투명 액티비티의 theme을  `android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar""`로 설정하면

반면 `FragmentTransaction.add` 함수를 통해 A Fragment 위에 B Fragment를 호출할 경우, B Fragment의 투명성과 무관하게 A Fragment는 RESUMED 상태를 유지합니다.
또한 B Fragment에 touch Event를 처리할 view가 없다면, A Fragment로 touch Event가 전달됩니다.

Activity와 Fragment를 비교한 이유는 ChatGPT가  ""Android에서, View(투명한지와 무관)가 touch event를 처리(consume)하지 않으면 touch event는 그 아래에 있는 View로 전달된다.""고 알려줬는데, Activity에서도 동일한지 확인하고 싶었습니다.

Activity와 Fragment의 lifecylcle 처리 방식이 다르기 때문에, 투명한 View가 앞에 있을 때의 결과가 다르다는 것을 배웠습니다.

"What I want to ask is why underlying fragment is clicked, not SettingFragment.","I see, sorry for misunderstanding your question earlier. If your SettingFragment is being displayed but not receiving clicks, it could be because it does not have a view which can receive the click events, hence they're being passed down to the underlying fragment.When using Fragments with transparent or semi-transparent backgrounds, you have to ensure that the area which should respond to touch events (e.g., the controls of your SettingFragment) is not transparent. Any click events on a transparent area will pass through to the underlying view or fragment.If the controls in your SettingFragment are not receiving clicks:Make sure that the controls themselves are not transparent.Make sure that they have android:clickable=""true"" in their XML attributes.If there are areas in your SettingFragment that should not respond to clicks but should block the clicks from passing down to the underlying fragment:You can use the method I described earlier, adding a full-sized, transparent View to your SettingFragment layout and consuming the touch events there. This view will not respond to the touch events, but will prevent them from reaching the underlying fragment.Note: Ensure that the View for blocking touch events is at the bottom of your XML layout file, so that it doesn't interfere with your SettingFragment's controls.If you continue to face issues, please provide more details about your SettingFragment layout and how it's being used, and I'll be glad to provide more specific advice.",[],Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

"Then, it's no matter with transparent, just is there any view can receiving click?","Yes, you're correct. If a fragment or view is transparent (or semi-transparent) and doesn't consume touch events (for example, by being set as clickable or by having an onTouchListener that consumes the event), then the touch events will pass through to the underlying views or fragments.Even if a view is visible and opaque, if it's not set as clickable or doesn't otherwise consume the touch event, the event can still pass through to underlying views.This means that even if your SettingFragment is displayed on top, if a click happens on a part of it that's transparent or not set to handle clicks, the click will go through to the underlying fragment.Consequently, it's important to ensure that you have something in your SettingFragment that can consume the touch events where needed.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

"When add FragmentTransaction called, underlying fragment's onPause or onStop is not called, no matter added Fragment is transparent or not.

Why `onPause` or `onStop` is not called?","When one Fragment is added on top of another using FragmentTransaction, the underlying Fragment's onPause() or onStop() methods aren't called because the underlying Fragment's lifecycle doesn't necessarily change.This is because Fragments have their own lifecycle, separate from the Activity's lifecycle. Adding a new Fragment doesn't necessarily pause or stop the existing Fragments, unless the Fragment Manager decides to do so due to resource constraints or a configuration change, for instance.The Android developer documentation provides detailed information on the lifecycle of a Fragment. According to the documentation, the onPause() method is called when the Fragment is no longer resumed, and onStop() is called when the Fragment is no longer visible to the user.However, if you're adding a Fragment on top of another, the underlying Fragment is technically still ""resumed"" and ""visible"" as far as the Fragment Manager is concerned, even though from the user's perspective, they can't interact with it. That's why these methods aren't called in the underlying Fragment.If you need to do something when a new Fragment is added on top, you may have to manually call a method or use some other mechanism (like a shared ViewModel) to communicate between your Fragments.Remember that Fragments in Android are designed to be modular and reusable components, so their lifecycle is intentionally kept as independent as possible. This means that it's generally not a good idea to rely on one Fragment's lifecycle affecting another.",[],Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.

Then underlying fragment's lifecycle is RESUMED?,"Yes, in the case of adding a fragment on top of another fragment, the underlying fragment is still technically in the ""RESUMED"" state in its lifecycle.This is because in Android, the fragment lifecycle is handled somewhat independently of the UI's visibility.

"I has a question about your answer `If a fragment or view is transparent (or semi-transparent) and doesn't consume touch events (for example, by being set as clickable or by having an onTouchListener that consumes the event), then the touch events will pass through to the underlying views or fragments.`

Then, if a fragment or view is not transparent and not consume touch event, the touch events will not pass through to the underlying views or fragments?","Yes, you're correct. If a view or fragment is not transparent and doesn't consume a touch event, it still won't pass the event down to any underlying views or fragments.This is because, in Android, the touch event is dispatched from the top of the view hierarchy (i.e., the root view) down to the child views. Once a view that can handle the touch event is found, it consumes the event, and the event dispatching stops.A view will consume a touch event if:The view is visible.The view is enabled.The view has a listener attached that can respond to the touch event (like an OnClickListener, OnTouchListener, etc.).The view's onTouchEvent() method returns true.So, even an opaque view that doesn't consume the touch event won't pass it to the underlying views, because from the Android system's perspective, the touch event has already been handled.That being said, it's best practice to ensure that any visible views in your UI either handle the touch events appropriately or explicitly allow them to pass through to underlying views if that's the intended behavior. This can help prevent confusion or unexpected behavior in your app's UI.",[],Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

You can consume the event by setting an OnTouchListener or adding a clickable view.Here is an example of how you can consume the touch event with an OnTouchListener:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The lambda function { _, _ -> true } here consumes the touch event (by returning true), which prevents it from being passed on to the underlying views or fragments.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'kotlin', 'Content': 'val settingFragment = view.findViewById<ConstraintLayout>(R.id.setting_fragment)\nsettingFragment.setOnTouchListener { _, _ -> true }\n'}]",Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

I appreciate your patience and I would like to correct that.In Android, if a view (opaque or transparent) does not consume a touch event, the touch event will indeed pass through to the underlying views or fragments.This means that if a ViewGroup (like your ConstraintLayout) doesn't contain any child views that can consume the event, and the ViewGroup itself does not have an onTouchListener set (or any other way of consuming the event), the event will be passed to the next possible receiver in the hierarchy beneath it.I hope this clears up the confusion, and I'm sorry for any misunderstanding caused by the previous responses.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

AndroidManifest에서 투명 액티비티의 theme을  `android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar""`로 설정하면

반면 `FragmentTransaction.add` 함수를 통해 A Fragment 위에 B Fragment를 호출할 경우, B Fragment의 투명성과 무관하게 A Fragment는 RESUMED 상태를 유지합니다.
또한 B Fragment에 touch Event를 처리할 view가 없다면, A Fragment로 touch Event가 전달됩니다.

Activity와 Fragment를 비교한 이유는 ChatGPT가  ""Android에서, View(투명한지와 무관)가 touch event를 처리(consume)하지 않으면 touch event는 그 아래에 있는 View로 전달된다.""고 알려줬는데, Activity에서도 동일한지 확인하고 싶었습니다.

Activity와 Fragment의 lifecylcle 처리 방식이 다르기 때문에, 투명한 View가 앞에 있을 때의 결과가 다르다는 것을 배웠습니다.

It is also applied at Activity or just at Fragment?,"The concept of touch events passing through views that don't consume them applies to all views and view groups in Android, including those used within both Activities and Fragments.The way Android handles touch events is based on the view hierarchy. When a touch event occurs, Android starts at the root of the view hierarchy and goes down through the hierarchy until it finds a view that can handle the touch event.If a view or a view group (like a ConstraintLayout or LinearLayout) doesn't consume the touch event (either because it's not set as clickable, doesn't have a touch/click listener set, or its onTouchEvent method doesn't return true), the event is passed on to the next eligible view beneath it in the hierarchy.So, whether it's an Activity or a Fragment, if you have layered views or view groups and the top ones don't consume the touch events, those events will pass through to the views or view groups underneath.",[],Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

What happen if transparent activity in front of other activity?,"If you have an Activity with a transparent theme in front of another Activity, the Activity in the back will continue to receive touch events if the Activity in front does not consume them.The top-most Activity's Views will first receive the touch events. If none of these Views consume the event (for example, because they are not clickable, or do not have touch/click listeners), the event will be passed down through the view hierarchy to the underlying Activity.This can be used to create interesting effects, like an overlay or a floating Activity on top of another, but it can also lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.It's important to ensure that the foreground Activity consumes the touch events where it should, to prevent unexpected interactions with the background Activity. If you don't want the background Activity to interact with the user while the foreground Activity is open, you can consume all touch events in the foreground Activity.For example, you could set an onTouchListener on the root view of your foreground Activity that returns true, which would consume all touch events:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Replace R.id.root_view with the actual id of your root view.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'kotlin', 'Content': 'findViewById<View>(R.id.root_view).setOnTouchListener { _, _ -> true }\n'}]",Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

"But when I run transparent activity through `startActivity(Intent(this, TransparentActivity::class.java))` at A activity, A activity is stopped.

What's the difference? How to simulate what you say which is touch event pass through at Activity? Is there other way to start activity which is not `startActivity`?","You're correct, and I apologize for any confusion. By default in Android, when you start a new activity (TransparentActivity in your case) from another activity (ActivityA), the system calls onPause() and then onStop() on the first activity (ActivityA). This is standard behavior and is part of the activity lifecycle in Android, as starting a new activity puts the current activity into the stopped state.Even if the new activity (TransparentActivity) is transparent, the first activity (ActivityA) will still be stopped. Therefore, by default, touch events won't be delivered to the first activity (ActivityA), since it's in the stopped state.One way to make touch events pass through to an underlying activity is to use a special type of activity called a Dialog Activity, which is like a dialog but has activity lifecycle. Dialog activities can let touch events pass through to the underlying activity, but there are some restrictions and issues you should consider, such as managing the lifecycle and state of the dialog activity and the underlying activity.Here's an example of how to create a Dialog Activity:In your AndroidManifest.xml, set the activity's theme to a dialog theme, such as @android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the layout XML of your Dialog Activity, make sure the root view or layout is not set to match_parent for both width and height, otherwise it will cover the whole screen and touch events won't go through to the underlying activity.Please note that dialog activities have their own complexities and should be used carefully. They are generally not recommended for large or complex UIs.Lastly, keep in mind that allowing touch events to pass through activities can lead to a confusing user experience, as users might not understand why their touches are interacting with the underlying UI when a new activity or dialog is shown on top. So, it's important to carefully consider the user experience when designing these types of interactions.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<activity android:name="".YourDialogActivity""\n          android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar""/>\n'}]",Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.

I got `java.lang.IllegalStateException: You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity.` Error when set theme,"I'm sorry for the confusion. The issue you're experiencing is because your Activity is likely extending AppCompatActivity, which requires a theme derived from Theme.AppCompat. In this case, instead of using the @android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar theme directly, you should create a new style in your styles.xml file that inherits from an AppCompat theme and has the required transparency properties.For example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, in your `AndroidManifest","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<style name=""Theme.MyTranslucent"" parent=""Theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar"">\n    <item name=""android:windowIsTranslucent"">true</item>\n    <item name=""android:windowBackground"">@android:color/transparent</item>\n    <item name=""android:windowContentOverlay"">@null</item>\n    <item name=""android:windowNoTitle"">true</item>\n    <item name=""android:windowIsFloating"">true</item>\n    <item name=""android:backgroundDimEnabled"">false</item>\n</style>\n'}]",Transparent Frag Interaction._https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/37#discussioncomment-6527669,False,,2022-05-28T15:16:46Z,,,Kotlin,DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI,2023-07-25T14:45:52Z,0.0,Transparent Frag Interaction.,"@BeokBeok Fragment는 이 글에 추가로 작성하겠습니다.

# Activity
Activity는 다음의 lifecycle callback 함수를 가진다.
onCreate() -> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()
## onCreate()
system이 activity를 처음 만들 때 호출된다.
activity의 생명 주기에서 오직 한 번만 실행되어야 하는 초기 설정 로직을 여기에 작성한다.
ex) 데이터를 view list에 바인딩한다, viewModel을 생성한다.

onCreate 함수는 savedInstanceState 파라미터를 입력받는다. 
savedInstanceState는 Activity의 이전 상태를 Bundle object로 가지고 있고, activity가 이전에 존재한 적 없다면 null이다.

onSaveInstanceState 함수는 Activity가 일시적으로 destroy 되면 호출된다. 여기서 기존 상태 값을 저장할 수 있다.
저장된 값은 activity를 재생성할 때, savedInstanceState 변수를 통해 복원할 수 있다.
onRestoreInstanceState 함수는 onSaveInstanceState 함수를 통해 저장한 값이 있으면 호출된다.

이 함수는 onStart 함수가 완료된 후 호출된다.

layout을 XML 파일로 생성하는 대신, activity code에서 view를 생성하고, 생성한 view를 viewGroup에 넣어 view hierarchy를 생성할 수 있다.
ViewGroup을 setContentView의 파라미터로 설정하면 activity code에서 생성한 view가 화면에 보인다.

## onStart()
Activity가 Started state에 진입할 때 호출된다.

이 함수가 호출되면 Activity가 사용자에게 보인다.
앱은 activity가 foreground에 진입할 수 있도록, 상호작용할 수 있는 상태가 되도록 준비한다.

이 함수는 매우 빨리 완료된다.

## onResume()
Activity가 Resumed 상태가 되면, foreground 상태가 된다.
이후 system은 onResume() 함수를 호출한다.
이 상태에서 앱은 사용자와 상호작용한다.

이 상태는 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등을 하지 않으면 계속 지속된다.

Activity가 Resumed 상태일 때, lifecycle component는 화면이 사용자에게 보이고 foreground 상태일 때만 가능한 기능을 실행할 수 있다.
ex) camera preview

Interruptive event가 발생하면 activity는 Paused 상태가 되고, onPause() 함수가 호출된다.
Paused 상태에서 Resumed 상태가 되면 onResume() 함수가 다시 호출된다.

onResume()함수에서, Resumed 상태에서 Paused 상태가 되면 release 되는 component를 초기화하는 코드를 반드시 작성해야 한다.

멀티 윈도우 모드에서는 activity 화면이 보일지라도, 사용자가 activity가 속하지 않은 다른 window를 조작하고 있으면(activity가 foreground 상태가 아닐 때), activity는 Paused 상태가 된다.
따라서 Resumed 상태 일 때 동작하도록 설정한 기능은 Paused 상태가 되면 멈춘다.
사용자에게 화면이 보이지만 Paused 상태일 때 기능이 동작하기를 원한다면, activity가 Started 상태일 때 기능이 시작하도록 해야 한다.

하지만 카메라와 같이 여러 앱이 공용으로 사용하는 시스템 자원은 여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 없으므로, Started 상태일 때 시작되는 기능은 신중하게 선택해야 한다.
예를 들어 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 A 앱이 Started 상태에서 카메라를 실행시키고 B 앱으로 전환된 경우, B 앱은 카메라를 사용할 수 없다.
여러 앱이 동시에 사용할 수 있지만, 배터리를 많이 소모하는 GPS와 같은 resource도 Paused 상태일 때 동작할 필요가 있는지 고민해봐야 한다.

lifecycle을 고려하여 리소스를 release하는 코드를 작성해야 한다.
onStart에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onStop에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.
onResume에서 리소스를 생성한 경우, onPause에서 리소스를 해제해야 한다.

## onPause()
activity가 더 이상 foreground에 있지 않을 때, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 이 상태에 진입하는 예는 다음과 같다.
1. 전화가 오거나, 다른 activity로 전환하거나, 화면을 끄는 행위 등
2. 멀티 윈도우 모드에서 사용자가 이 app을 사용하다가, 다른 app으로 focus를 전환했을 때
3. dialog와 같은 반투명 activity가 나타날 때

onPause 함수는 저장 기능을 수행할 만큼 동작 시간이 많이 주어지지 않는다.
app, 유저 데이터 저장, network call, database transaction과 같이 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

onPause 함수 실행이 완료되었다고 해서 Paused 상태를 벗어나는 것은 아니다.
onResume() 함수가 호출될 때까지, activity가 사용자에게 완전히 보여지지 않아 onStop() 함수가 호출될 때까지 Paused 상태를 유지한다.

## onStop()
activity가 더 이상 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때, Stopped 상태가 되고, system은 이 함수를 호출한다.
activity가 실행을 마치고, terminated 되기 직전에도 호출된다.

app이 사용자에게 보이지 않을 때 필요하지 않은 resource를 release 하거나 조정해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 animation 효과를 멈추거나, 정확한 GPS 사용에서 대략적인 GPS 사용모드로 전환해야 한다.

cpu 자원을 많이 필요로 하는, 시간이 오래 걸리는 종료 작업은 onStop 함수에서 수행되어야 한다.

Stopped 상태가 되더라도, 시스템이 process를 destroy 하지 않는 이상, 모든 상태와 변수 정보를 메모리에 가지고 있다.
시스템이 stopped 상태가 된 activity의 process를 destroy 하면, EditText에 입력한 text와 같은 view object의 상태만 Bundle 타입으로 가지고 있다. 나머지는 개발자가 직접 저장, 복원하는 코드를 처리해야 한다.

## onDestory()
activity가 destroy 되기 전에 onDestory 함수가 호출된다. system이 onDestroy 함수를 호출하는 경우는 다음과 같다.
1. 사용자가 뒤로가기 버튼을 눌러서 Activity를 종료하거나, Activity의 finish() 함수가 호출되어 activity가 종료되었을 때
2. 화면 회전, 멀티 윈도우 진입과 같은 configuration change 때문에 system이 activity를 일시적으로 destroy 하는 경우

lifecycle component는 Activity가 destroy 되기 전에 정리할 게 있으면 onDestory 함수에서 처리해야 한다.

view(UI)와 관련된 데이터는 이 함수에서 처리하지 말고, viewModel을 사용해서 관리해야 한다.
왜냐하면 viewModel은 별도의 로직을 직접 구현하지 않아도, activity가 재생성되면 기존에 viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 이용해서 복원해주기 때문이다.
viewModel이 속한 activity가 더 이상 재생성 되지 않으면 viewModel도 destroy 되고, destroy 되기 전에 onCleared() 함수가 호출된다. viewModel이 가지고 있는 데이터를 저장해야 한다면 onCleared() 함수에서 처리하면 된다.
자세한 내용은 https://github.com/DoTheBestMayB/UpbitAPI/discussions/36

Activity가 종료되면 onDestroy 함수가 마지막으로 호출된다.
Activity가 시스템에 의해 일시적으로 destroy 됐다면, 나중에 onCreate 함수가 호출된다.

## 수명주기 인식 구성요소(Lifecycle-aware component)
이 함수를 구현하면, 여러 activity에서 해당 함수를 사용할 수 있다.
activity의 lifecycle이 변경되면 Lifecycle-aware component는 Life cycle event를 수신한다. ex) ON_START, ON_PAUSE, ON_STOP 등
foreground가 아니면 실행할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_PAUSE event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.
화면이 보이지 않을 때 동작할 필요가 없는 함수는 ON_STOP event를 수신했을 때 멈추면 된다.


### 기타
startActivity(intent: Intent) 함수를 사용하면 activity에서 다른 activity를 실행할 수 있다.
실행한 activity로부터 결과를 전달받아야 한다면 startActivityForResult() 함수를 사용하면 된다.
이때, 실행한 activity와 실행된 activity의 lifecycle을 잘 고려해야 한다.

"What should I set to width and height?

In the layout XML of your Dialog Activity, make sure the root view or layout is not set to match_parent for both width and height, otherwise it will cover the whole screen and touch events won't go through to the underlying activity.","The width and height that you should set depends on your specific use case. The idea is to make sure that the dialog activity does not take up the entire screen, to allow for the possibility of touch events passing through to the underlying activity.You might want to set a specific dp value for width and height, or you might want to use wrap_content if you want the view to be only as big as required to fit its content.For example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This will create a LinearLayout that is 300dp x 300dp in size. You can replace 300dp with whatever size fits your design.Or:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This will create a LinearLayout that is only as big as required to fit its content.Again, the specific width and height you should use depends on your design requirements. Just keep in mind that if you set both width and height to match_parent, the layout will cover the entire screen and block touch events from reaching the underlying activity.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""\n    android:layout_width=""300dp""\n    android:layout_height=""300dp""\n    android:orientation=""vertical"">\n\n    <!-- your views here -->\n\n</LinearLayout>\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""\n    android:layout_width=""wrap_content""\n    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""\n    android:orientation=""vertical"">\n\n    <!-- your views here -->\n\n</LinearLayout>\n'}]",Python to JS Translation_https://github.com/operand/agency/discussions/107#discussioncomment-6699625,False,,2023-08-10T02:59:54Z,,,Python,operand/agency,2023-08-11T22:35:15Z,2.0,Python to JS Translation,"If you look at the [React example index.html](https://github.com/operand/agency/blob/main/examples/demo/apps/templates/index.html), there's the beginnings of a simple JS client that could be used to define Javascript based agents that can integrate with the python-based `Space`'s.

This is the case even if the new activity is transparent. So, starting a new activity puts the current activity into the background, even if you can still see it due to the transparency of the new activity.When an activity is in the paused or stopped state, it can't interact with user input and won't receive touch events.A possible workaround is to use a dialog or dialog-themed activity which doesn't pause the underlying activity. However, remember that dialogs and dialog-themed activities have their own complexities and limitations, and are best used for small, simple user interfaces.As an alternative, you might want to consider using a Fragment or a View for your overlay instead of an Activity. This would allow the underlying activity to stay in the resumed state and continue to receive touch events, if desired.

How to make TransparentActivity  to dialog,"To make your activity behave like a dialog, you need to make two changes:Update your AndroidManifest.xml to specify a dialog theme for your activity:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note: If you are using an AppCompatActivity, you would need to use a theme that inherits from Theme.AppCompat, as described in a previous message.Update your activity layout to ensure that it doesn't fill the entire screen. This allows click events to pass outside of the view to the underlying activity. The layout width and height should be set to wrap_content or a specific dimension, but not match_parent.[CODE_BLOCK_1]These changes will make your activity appear like a dialog and allow clicks to pass through to the underlying activity, because it does not cover the entire screen.Again, please note that managing a dialog-styled activity properly can have complexities, especially around lifecycle management and touch handling. Use this approach carefully, and consider whether a different UI approach may be more appropriate for your needs.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<activity \n    android:name="".TransparentActivity""\n    android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"">\n</activity>\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout \n    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""\n    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""\n    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""\n    android:layout_width=""300dp""\n    android:layout_height=""300dp""\n    android:background=""@android:color/transparent""\n    tools:context="".ui.game.TransparentActivity"">\n\n</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>\n'}]",OpenBSD Makefile Sorcery_https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD/discussions/1103#discussioncomment-6542183,False,,2020-12-09T13:56:26Z,False,1.0,C,OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD,2023-07-26T15:08:52Z,1.0,OpenBSD Makefile Sorcery,"## 👋 Welcome!

I already setting theme.,"I apologize for misunderstanding your question earlier. If you've already set the theme, then it seems like your activity is well configured to behave like a dialog.To convert your TransparentActivity into a dialog-styled Activity, you don't need to make significant changes. The main changes are in how you define the activity in your manifest file, and in setting up the layout of your activity to not occupy the entire screen (which you already did).Here's how your activity should be set up in the manifest:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Your layout should not occupy the entire screen:[CODE_BLOCK_1]And your activity class is also very standard:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Now, when you start TransparentActivity, it should appear like a dialog over your existing activity. If your layout doesn't fill the entire screen, touch events outside of your layout should go through to the underlying activity. If this is not the case, there might be something else in your code that's interfering with this behavior.If you want to stop all touch events from being passed to the underlying activity, you can set an OnTouchListener to your ConstraintLayout and consume all touch events:[CODE_BLOCK_3]This will consume all touch events on the layout, and prevent them from being passed to the underlying activity.","[{'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_0]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<activity android:name="".TransparentActivity"" \n          android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"">\n</activity>\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_1]', 'Type': 'xml', 'Content': '<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout \n    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""\n    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""\n    xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""\n    android:layout_width=""300dp""\n    android:layout_height=""300dp""\n    android:background=""@android:color/transparent""\n    tools:context="".ui.game.TransparentActivity"">\n</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_2]', 'Type': 'kotlin', 'Content': 'class TransparentActivity : Activity() {\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_transparent)\n    }\n}\n'}, {'ReplaceString': '[CODE_BLOCK_3]', 'Type': 'kotlin', 'Content': 'val layout = findViewById<ConstraintLayout>(R.id.your_layout_id)\nlayout.setOnTouchListener { v, event -> true }\n'}]",Data Issue: Incomplete Values_https://github.com/azimuth-project/azimuthproject/discussions/1#discussioncomment-6397038,False,,2023-05-02T20:01:07Z,False,1.0,Java,azimuth-project/azimuthproject,2023-07-17T15:53:45Z,2.0,Data Issue: Incomplete Values,"Earth science behaviors that are potentially not chaotic  ...  $x \neq \text{chaotic}$

"I said I already what you say, but activity which below at TransparentActivity is stopped and not getting touch event.","Apologies for the confusion. It seems there's a bit of a misunderstanding here.By design, when you start an Activity in Android, the system calls onPause on the currently running activity, even if the new Activity is translucent or transparent. That is Android's lifecycle management and it's not something we can change.A Dialog or a DialogFragment allows user interaction with underlying components because they're part of the same Activity, they don't create a new one.That's why, if you need a transparent or translucent overlay that allows interaction with the views below, you should consider using either a Dialog, a DialogFragment, or custom views with a transparent background. If you use an Activity for this, the Android system will pause the underlying activity, and you won't be able to interact with it.If you really need to use an Activity for this, you would have to override the onTouchEvent method in the translucent activity and manually pass the touch events to the underlying activity, which would need to be in a state where it could handle them. This is more complex, not a standard way of handling this situation, and should be used as a last resort.I hope this clarifies the situation a bit better.

"I'm working on code from openbsd.

There is a construct in a makefile:

.include <bsd.subdir.mk>

There does not seem to be any such file anywhere on my system, which laves the makefile bereft of it's most essential organs ... but yet the best will not die!

What sorcerer did this accursed thing, and how can it be undone?","Fear not, for the construct you encountered in the OpenBSD makefile is not the result of sorcery, but rather a built-in mechanism in OpenBSD's make utility. The .include <bsd.subdir.mk> is not a file that you're supposed to find in your system, but rather a directive that includes the bsd.subdir.mk makefile fragment provided by OpenBSD's build system.The bsd.subdir.mk file contains rules and targets that are essential for building software within the OpenBSD project. It sets up the necessary build environment and includes rules for building individual directories (subdirectories) within the larger project. The file is not meant to be present on your system as a standalone file, but rather it is included by the main makefile during the build process.If you're working on a particular project that uses OpenBSD's build system, you should have the necessary bsd.subdir.mk included in the project's source tree. The build system is designed to handle this inclusion automatically when you run make in the project's root directory.To undo this, you don't need to remove or find bsd.subdir.mk yourself. Instead, you should ensure that you have the complete source tree of the project you're working on, and then simply run make from the project's root directory. The build system will handle the inclusion of bsd.subdir.mk and take care of the rest of the build process.If you don't have the full source tree of the project or if you encounter issues with the build process, you may want to check the project's documentation or community support channels for guidance on setting up the build environment correctly.",[],Data Issue: Incomplete Values_https://github.com/azimuth-project/azimuthproject/discussions/1#discussioncomment-6397038,False,,2023-05-02T20:01:07Z,False,1.0,Java,azimuth-project/azimuthproject,2023-07-17T15:53:45Z,2.0,Data Issue: Incomplete Values,"Earth science behaviors that are potentially not chaotic  ...  $x \neq \text{chaotic}$

"Overfitting is the point of this exercise, to demonstrate it's effects, So try using 20 dinusoidal factors.","The optimization procedure did not complete because it took too long to execute. The computational complexity of the Fourier series model increases substantially when the number of sinusoidal factors is large. Here are a few possible next steps:Use fewer sinusoidal factors: Although this will reduce the potential overfitting, it may not provide the desired level of detail in the fit.Use a different optimization algorithm: Some algorithms may be more efficient than Nelder-Mead for this problem. However, this depends on the nature of the loss surface and the specific problem.Use a different model: A Fourier series may not be the best model for this data. Other models, such as spline models or even machine learning models, could provide a better fit.Use a subset of the data: If the dataset is very large, it might be feasible to fit the model to a subset of the data. This could speed up the optimization process, but it may also reduce the quality of the fit.For demonstration purposes, if you want to proceed with overfitting, it would be ideal to use fewer sinusoidal factors to keep the computation within reasonable time limits.

To see what's new, see [the release notes](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/182).

## Installation
First, update your `package.json` to specify v4:

```json
  ""openai"": ""^4.0.0""
```
and run `npm install` or equivalent to download the new version.

<h2 id=""automatic-migration"">Automatic migration</h2>

You can automatically migrate your codebase using [grit](https://grit.io), either [online](https://app.grit.io/migrations/new/openai_v4) or with the following CLI command:

```sh
npm exec openai migrate
```

The grit binary executes entirely locally with AST-based transforms. 

Be sure to audit its changes: we suggest ensuring you have a clean working tree beforehand, and running `git add --patch` afterwards. Note that grit.io also offers opt-in automatic fixes powered by AI.

## Manual migration

There are changes in the initialization logic, method names, error handling. The API parameter names should be unchanged.

#### Initialization

// New
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY // This is also the default, can be omitted
});
```

#### Creating a chat completion
```typescript
// Old
const chatCompletion = await openai.createChatCompletion({

  stream: true,
});
for await (const part of stream) {
  console.log(part.choices[0]);
}
```

#### Error handling
```typescript
// Old
try {
  const completion = await openai.createCompletion({...});
} catch (error) {
  if (error.response) {
    console.log(error.response.status); // e.g. 401
    console.log(error.response.data.message); // e.g. The authentication token you passed was invalid...
    console.log(error.response.data.code); // e.g. 'invalid_api_key'
    console.log(error.response.data.type); // e.g. 'invalid_request_error'
  } else {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

// New
try {
  const response = await openai.completions.create({...});
} catch (error) {

    console.error(error.code);  // e.g. 'invalid_api_key'
    console.error(error.type);  // e.g. 'invalid_request_error'
  } else {

Can try using an FFT-based harmonic analysis where the fit uses the strongest 20 spectral peaks?,"The Pearson correlation coefficient on the training data is approximately 0.63, and on the testing data it is approximately 0.04. This is a sign of overfitting, where the model is fitting the training data relatively well, but performs poorly on the testing data.The plot above shows the actual data (for both training and testing periods) and the predictions made by the FFT model. The model seems to fit the training data well, capturing the main features of the time series. However, the predictions for the testing data do not align well with the actual values, which is consistent with the low Pearson correlation coefficient for the testing data.This demonstrates the effect of overfitting: the model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data, which reduces its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.",[],Zero Bits_https://github.com/uuid6/prototypes/discussions/46#discussioncomment-6114220,False,,2023-06-07T15:06:44Z,False,1.0,Python,uuid6/prototypes,2023-06-09T13:00:30Z,5.0,Zero Bits,"Feel free to share the poll.

v4 is a complete rewrite of the SDK. To see what's new, see the release notes.

Installation
First, update your package.json to specify v4:

  ""openai"": ""^4.0.0""
and run npm install or equivalent to download the new version.

Automatic migration
You can automatically migrate your codebase using grit, either online or with the following CLI command:

npm exec openai migrate
The grit binary executes entirely locally with AST-based transforms.

Be sure to audit its changes: we suggest ensuring you have a clean working tree beforehand, and running git add --patch afterwards. Note that grit.io also offers opt-in automatic fixes powered by AI.

Manual migration
There are changes in the initialization logic, method names, error handling. The API parameter names should be unchanged.

Initialization
// Old
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from ""openai"";

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

// New
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY // This is also the default, can be omitted
});
Creating a chat completion
// Old
const chatCompletion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: ""gpt-3.5-turbo"",
  messages: [{role: ""user"", content: ""Hello world""}],
});
console.log(chatCompletion.data.choices[0].message);

// New
const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: ""gpt-3.5-turbo"",
  messages: [{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Hello!""}],
});
console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0].message);
Creating a streaming chat completion (new)
// Old
// Not supported

// New
const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: ""gpt-3.5-turbo"",
  messages: [{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Hello!""}],
  stream: true,
});
for await (const part of stream) {
  console.log(part.choices[0].delta);
}
Creating a completion
// Old
const completion = await openai.createCompletion({
  model: ""text-davinci-003"",
  prompt: ""This story begins"",
  max_tokens: 30,
});
console.log(completion.data.choices[0].text);

// New
const completion = await openai.completions.create({
  model: ""text-davinci-003"",
  prompt: ""This story begins"",
  max_tokens: 30,
});
console.log(completion.choices[0].text);
Creating a transcription (whisper)
// Old
const response = await openai.createTranscription(
  fs.createReadStream(""audio.mp3""),
  ""whisper-1""
);

// New
const response = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  model: 'whisper-1',
  file: fs.createReadStream('audio.mp3'),
});
Creating a streaming completion (new)
// Old
// Not supported

// New
const stream = await openai.completions.create({
  model: ""text-davinci-003"",
  prompt: ""This story begins"",
  max_tokens: 30,
  stream: true,
});
for await (const part of stream) {
  console.log(part.choices[0]);
}
Error handling
// Old
try {
  const completion = await openai.createCompletion({...});
} catch (error) {
  if (error.response) {
    console.log(error.response.status); // e.g. 401
    console.log(error.response.data.message); // e.g. The authentication token you passed was invalid...
    console.log(error.response.data.code); // e.g. 'invalid_api_key'
    console.log(error.response.data.type); // e.g. 'invalid_request_error'
  } else {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

// New
try {
  const response = await openai.completions.create({...});
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {
    console.error(error.status);  // e.g. 401
    console.error(error.message); // e.g. The authentication token you passed was invalid...
    console.error(error.code);  // e.g. 'invalid_api_key'
    console.error(error.type);  // e.g. 'invalid_request_error'
  } else {
    // Non-API error
    console.log(error);
  }
}
All method name changes
To migrate these automatically, see Automatic migration, above

Can you make a list of used terms?,"Certainly! Here is a list of commonly used terms related to binary numbers and bit strings:Bit: The basic unit of information in computing, representing a binary digit (0 or 1).Binary Number: A number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, consisting of 0s and 1s.Bit String: A sequence of bits, which can represent various types of data.Zero: A value where all bits in a binary number or bit string are set to zero (0).All-Ones Value: A value where all bits in a binary number or bit string are set to one (1). It represents the maximum value or a special marker depending on the context.Sign Bit: The leftmost bit in a signed number representation, indicating the sign (positive or negative).Least Significant Bit (LSB): The rightmost bit in a binary number or bit string, representing the smallest value.Most Significant Bit (MSB): The leftmost bit in a binary number or bit string, representing the largest value.Bitwise Operations: Operations performed on individual bits, such as AND, OR, XOR, shifting, and negation.Bitwise AND: A binary operation that produces a result by comparing corresponding bits in two binary numbers. The result is 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it is 0.Bitwise OR: A binary operation that produces a result by comparing corresponding bits in two binary numbers. The result is 1 if at least one bit is 1; otherwise, it is 0.Bitwise XOR: A binary operation that produces a result by comparing corresponding bits in two binary numbers. The result is 1 if the bits are different; otherwise, it is 0.Bitwise Shift: An operation that moves the bits of a binary number to the left or right by a specified number of positions.Two's Complement: A method of representing signed integers in binary, where the leftmost bit is the sign bit, and the remaining bits represent the magnitude of the number.These are some of the commonly used terms in the realm of binary numbers and bit strings.

I am trying to regenerate pair correlation functions for Gaussian potentials in continuous space using the Deep Sets neural network that the results of this article (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11957)

```python

    distances = (-x[jnp.newaxis, :, :] + x[:, jnp.newaxis, :])[
        jnp.triu_indices(n_particles, 1)
    ]
    distances = jnp.remainder(distances + L / 2.0, L) - L / 2.0

and for calculation and plotting pair correlation function, I wrote this code:



```python
import numpy as np
hist_bins = 50
hist_range = (0, L/2.0)

all_histograms = []
for sample in vs.samples:
    d = minimum_distance(sample, 1)
    hist, _ = np.histogram(d, bins=hist_bins, range=hist_range, density=True)
    all_histograms.append(hist)

 ##Computing average histogram##
average_hist = np.mean(all_histograms, axis=0)
bin_edges = np.linspace(hist_range[0], hist_range[1], hist_bins+1)

 ##Plotting histograms for all samples##
for hist in all_histograms:
    plt.plot(bin_edges[:-1], hist, alpha=0.3)

 ##Plotting the average histogram##
plt.plot(bin_edges[:-1], average_hist, 'r', linewidth=2)

plt.xlabel('Distance')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.title('Histogram of Distances')
plt.show()
```




To calculate and plot the pair correlation function from transformed samples, I used a histogram to plot the distribution of a single sample (using ""np.histogram""). Then, I repeated this process for all samples, plotted histograms for each of them, and calculated the average of all histograms. Finally, I plotted the pair correlation function.
When I plot the pair correlation function for a Gaussian potential, it will resemble the shape shown below(Note: the Red line is the averaging over all plots):

I have tried the run this code for different potentials that have Kato’s Cusp exponent. It involves plotting the potential shape and obtaining the corresponding results. The process is as follows, for example, for Aziz Potential  the figure of the pair correlation function looks like this :

This figure visually reproduces the shape of the article's figure titled ""Neural-Network Quantum States for Periodic Systems in Continuous Space"".

I'm not sure why I'm not getting reasonable results for Gaussian potential. I would like to understand the underlying cause and find a solution to obtain meaningful outcomes. Your assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.
